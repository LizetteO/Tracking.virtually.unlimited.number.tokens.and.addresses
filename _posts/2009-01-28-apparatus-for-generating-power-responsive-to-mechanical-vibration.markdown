There is a growing interest in the field of miniature sensors in applications such as medical implants and embedded sensors in buildings. One of the projected goals for micro electro mechanical systems MEMS technology is to develop low cost and high performance distributed sensor systems for medical automotive manufacturing robotics and household applications. One area that has received little attention is how to effectively supply the required electrical power to such sensor elements. Many applications require the sensors to be completely embedded in a structure with no physical connection to the outside world. Ideally the elements of these distributed systems have their own integrated power supplies to reduce problems related to interconnection electronic noise and control system complexity. Efforts are underway to develop integrated chemically based power supplies with MEMS devices. Chemical power supply battery technology is well developed for such applications but where shelf life or replacement accessibility is a limiting factor chemical power supplies may not be suitable for the application. Another approach to supplying power to such systems is to include a renewable power supply within the sensor element thereby making them self powered microsystems.

Renewable power supplies convert energy harvested from an existing energy source within the environment into electrical energy. The preferred source of energy depends on the application. Some possible energy sources include optical energy from ambient light such as sunlight thermal energy harvested across a temperature gradient volume flow energy harvested across a liquid or gas pressure gradient and mechanical energy harvested from motion and vibration. Of these sources light and thermal energy have already been exploited for use in micro power supplies. However there are many applications where there is an insufficient amount of light or thermal energy such as in medical implants. Therefore practitioners in the art have proposed many different power supplies that generate electricity from ambient mechanical energy. Ambient mechanical vibrations inherent in the environment from the movement of our bodies to the hum of a computer can provide a constant power density of 10 to 50 W cc.

Several practitioners have proposed rudimentary vibration based power generators at the University of Sheffield C. B. Williams R. B. Yates Analysis of a micro electric generator for micro systems 8 . Stockholm Sweden 25 29 Jun. 1995 87 B4 pp. 369 72 and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Scott Meninger Jose Oscar Mur Miranda Rajeevan Amirtharajah Anantha P. Chandrakasan and Jeffrey H. Lang Vibration to Electric Energy Conversion Vol. 9 No. 1 pp. 64 76 February 2001 for example. Meninger et al. describe a micro generator that harvests vibrational energy by accumulating the voltage created by vibration induced changes in a variable capacitor.

Others have recently improved on the earlier efforts. For example Ching et al. Neil N. H. Ching H. Y Wong Wen J. Li Philip H. W. Leong and Zhiyu Wen A laser micro machined multi modal resonating power transducer for wireless sensing systems Vol. 97 98 pp. 685 690 2002. describe a micromachined generator with enough power to drive an off the shelf circuit. For this work Ching et al. prefer micromachining methods to build their vibration induced power generator because the methods afford precise control of the mechanical resonance necessary for generator efficiency and batch fabricability for low cost mass production of commercially viable generators. Similarly Williams et al. later describe C. B. Williams C. Shearwood M. A. Harradine P. H. Mellor T. S. Birch and R. B. Yates Development of an electromagnetic micro generator . Vol. 148 No. 6 pp. 337 342 December 2001 a simple inertial generator built according to their earlier theoretical analysis that is also fabricated by means of micromachining. Other examples include the laser micro machined electromagnetic generator described by Li et al. Wen J. Li Terry C. H. Ho Gordon M. H. Chan Philip H. W. Leong and Hui Yung Wong Infrared Signal Transmission by a Laser Micro machined Vibration Induced Power Generator 43 Lansing Mich. 08 11 Aug. 2000 pp 236 9 which provides 2 VDC power sufficient to send 140 ms pulse trains every minute when subjected to 250 micron vibrations in the 64 120 Hz region.

In U.S. Pat. No. 6 127 812 Ghezzo et al. describe an energy extractor that includes a capacitor that experiences capacitance and voltage changes in response to movement of a capacitor plate or of a dielectric material. In one embodiment a third plate is positioned between first and second plates to create two capacitors of varying capacitances. In another embodiment one capacitor plate is attached by flexible arms which permit movement across another capacitor plate. The above capacitors can be used singularly or with one or more other capacitors and are rectified either individually or in a cascaded arrangement for supplying power to a rechargeable energy source. The above capacitors can be fabricated on a substrate along with supporting electronics such as diodes. Ghezzo et al. employ varying capacitance and neither consider nor suggest any solution the problem of fabricating an electromagnetic micro generator.

In U.S. Pat. No. 6 722 206 B2 Takeda describes a force sensing device having an element of magnetic material mounted to a substrate such that another magneto electrical material element is subjected to the magnetic field generated by the magnetic member. A movable member is mounted for oscillation in response to vibration and such oscillation changes the magnetic field experienced by the magneto electrical material which in turn changes an electrical property of the magneto electrical material. Takeda neither considers nor suggests any solution to the problem of fabricating an electromagnetic micro generator.

Despite the efforts of several practitioners in the art there still exists a need in the art for an electromagnetic micro generator suitable for inexpensive fabrication in volume at the MEMS scale that can generate power sufficient for operating today s microchips. The electromagnetic devices known in the art all generally employ a single magnetic mass which oscillates on a spring element to change the magnetic flux at a nearby stationary coil. These devices are thereby limited in power output capacity by the limited mass of the single magnet the limited room for a number of coils in the flux field of the single magnet and the limited flux slope available at the coils because of the single magnetic pole exposed thereto. These unresolved problems and deficiencies are clearly felt in the art and are solved by this invention in the manner described below.

A vibrational energy harvesting apparatus is disclosed herein that comprises a substrate with a plurality of integral compliant regions at least two ferromagnetic masses and a coil. Each ferromagnetic mass is coupled to a corresponding one or more of the integral compliant regions such that at least one of the ferromagnetic masses moves with respect to the substrate responsive to substrate acceleration. Each ferromagnetic mass has an inner magnetic pole disposed such that the inner magnetic poles are separated from one another by a flux gap. The magnetic polarity of each inner magnetic pole is similar to the magnetic polarity of the inner magnetic pole on the opposing side of the flux gap. The inner magnetic poles form a steep flux gradient region in and around the flux gap. The coil is coupled to the substrate and disposed within the steep flux gradient region where it is exposed to a changing magnetic flux arising from motion of at least one of the ferromagnetic masses with respect to the substrate.

In an alternate embodiment of the energy harvesting apparatus described above the two ferromagnetic masses may be rigidly coupled to one another and disposed to move synchronously.

In another alternate embodiment of the energy harvesting apparatus described above the coupled ferromagnetic masses may be configured to move linearly with respect to the substrate responsive to substrate acceleration.

In another alternate embodiment of the energy harvesting apparatus described above conductors may be coupled to the coil for conducting electrical current flowing in response to the changing magnetic flux.

In another alternate embodiment of the energy harvesting apparatus described above the coil may comprise a plurality of independent coils coupled to the substrate and disposed within the steep flux gradient region where the plurality of independent coils are exposed to the changing magnetic flux.

In another alternate embodiment of the energy harvesting apparatus described above the coil may be disposed within the steep flux gradient region within the flux gap.

In another alternate embodiment of the energy harvesting apparatus described above the coil may be disposed within the steep flux gradient region outside the flux gap.

The vibrational energy harvesting apparatus may be constructed as a micro electro mechanical system MEMS power generator comprising a substrate having a plurality of integral compliant regions at least one monolithic micro generator a coil and conductors. In this embodiment each monolithic micro generator comprises at least two ferromagnetic masses. Each ferromagnetic mass may be coupled to a corresponding one or more of the integral compliant regions such that at least one of the ferromagnetic masses moves with respect to the substrate responsive to substrate acceleration. Each ferromagnetic mass has an inner magnetic pole disposed such that the inner magnetic poles of the ferromagnetic masses are of the same magnetic polarity and are separated from one another by a flux gap. The inner magnetic poles form a steep flux gradient region in and around the flux gap. The coil is coupled to the substrate and disposed within the steep flux gradient region where it is exposed to a changing magnetic flux arising from motion of at least one of the ferromagnetic masses with respect to the substrate. The conductors are coupled to each micro generator coil for conducting electrical current flowing in response to the magnetic flux changes.

This is a non linear problem and because of the nonlinear nature of the reaction force from the coil current the system resonance may be optimized with reference to Eqn. 7 for a given application without undue experimentation. In general the inventors have discovered that a higher electrical damping bimproves power output performance at frequencies below the mechanical resonant frequency f 2 of the system.

A macro scale version of the energy harvesting device was fabricated to verify the expected voltage output per coil. The experimental setup consisted of a one Tesla magnet measuring one inch in diameter and 3 16 inches in thickness. It was attached to a spring with sufficient spring force to result in a displacement of 2.5 mm under accelerations of 1.0 m sat a frequency of 20 Hz. The number of turns in the coil was varied sequentially from 5 to 40 in increments of 5 and voltage output measurements were made for each configuration. It was observed that the voltage generated per turn of the coil was very close to the expected value of 1 mV turn using the simple one dimensional 1 D model described above.

A detailed analysis was performed by modeling the magnetic flux density in two dimensions and summing the total flux density normal to the surface of the coil. The input was once again assumed to be a 20 Hz sinusoidal input at 1.0 m s. At each time step the velocity displacement from the coil to the magnet and total magnetic flux density normal to the surface were calculated. The results of this detailed analysis confirmed the simple 1 D calculations and the macro scale experimental observations of 1 mV turn.

Based on measurements and calculations the inventors suggest that the MEMS power generator of this invention can provide an output power from 10 to 500 mW cc at an output voltage from 100 mV to 5 000 mV.
