The present invention relates to novel compounds to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds to a process for making the compounds and to the use of the compounds in therapy. More particularly it relates to certain substituted 1H pyrrolo 2 3 b pyridine compounds useful for inhibiting Raf kinase and for treating disorders mediated thereby.

The Raf MEK ERK pathway is critical for cell survival growth proliferation and tumorigenesis. Li Nanxin et al. B Raf kinase inhibitors for cancer treatment. . Vol. 8 No. 6 2007 452 456. Raf kinases exist as three isoforms A Raf B Raf and C Raf. Among the three isoforms studies have shown that B Raf functions as the primary MEK activator. B Raf is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers. B Raf kinase represents an excellent target for anticancer therapy based on preclinical target validation epidemiology and drugability.

Small molecule inhibitors of B Raf are being developed for anticancer therapy. Nexavar sorafenib tosylate is a multikinase inhibitor which includes inhibition of B Raf and is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

In preparing compounds of Formula I protection of remote functionalities e.g. primary or secondary amines etc. of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino protecting groups NH Pg include acetyl trifluoroacetyl t butyloxycarbonyl Boc benzyloxycarbonyl CBz and 9 fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl Fmoc . The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use see T. W. Greene et al. .

It may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and or purified hereinafter separated to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture distillation sublimation or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including for example reverse phase and normal phase size exclusion ion exchange high medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus small scale analytical simulated moving bed SMB and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.

Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher s acid chloride separating the diastereomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.

A single stereoisomer e.g. an enantiomer substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents Eliel E. and Wilen S. . New York John Wiley Sons Inc. 1994 Lochmuller C. H. et al. Chromatographic resolution of enantiomers Selective review. 113 3 1975 pp. 283 302 . Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method including 1 formation of ionic diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods 2 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents separation of the diastereomers and conversion to the pure stereoisomers and 3 separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See Wainer Irving W. Ed. . New York Marcel Dekker Inc. 1993.

Under method 1 diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine quinine ephedrine strychnine methyl phenylethylamine amphetamine and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids such as camphorsulfonic acid tartaric acid mandelic acid or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.

Alternatively by method 2 the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair Eliel E. and Wilen S. . New York John Wiley Sons Inc. 1994 p. 322 . Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents such as menthyl derivatives followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters such as a menthyl ester e.g. menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base or Mosher ester methoxy trifluoromethyl phenyl acetate Jacob III Peyton. Resolution of 5 Bromonornicotine. Synthesis of R and S Nornicotine of High Enantiomeric Purity. 47 No. 21 1982 pp. 4165 4167 of the racemic mixture and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal and reverse phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl isoquinolines WO 96 15111 .

By method 3 a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase Lough W. J. Ed. . New York Chapman and Hall 1989 Okamoto Yoshio et al. Optical resolution of dihydropyridine enantiomers by high performance liquid chromatography using phenylcarbamates of polysaccharides as a chiral stationary phase. . Vol. 513 1990 pp. 375 378 . Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.
