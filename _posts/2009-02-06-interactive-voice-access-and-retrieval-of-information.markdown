This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 054 460 filed May 19 2008 entitled System Method and Computer Program Product for Interactive Voice Access and Retrieval of information the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in it s entirety.

The present disclosure relates generally to automatic notification systems and more particularly to automatic notification systems that provide voice interaction.

Various conventional platforms provide textual interaction with multiple information databanks. However physical inability and multitasking have increasingly dictated the use of hands free systems such as voice response systems. While conventional resources such as the Internet or World Wide Web have provided users with a ready access to a wide array of information accessing such information has conventionally required text based queries. Similarly other services accessible either through the Internet or from other sources generally require a user to interface using text based key stroke commands. While voice response interfaces are available e.g. subscriber s voice mail system robust capabilities for information access is desirable. Furthermore existing voice response interfaces are limited to a particular function and are not readily adaptable to a user s information requirements. As society becomes more mobile i.e. access to wireless communication and more dependent on instantaneous dissemination of information notification of important information with the ability to confirm receipt of the information using voice response is desirable.

For example emergency responders e.g. firefighters search and rescue teams or others need to be contacted immediately to see who is nearby and available. Conventionally such life critical dispatching operations are left to human operators. Human operators contact the appropriate person and determine whether that person can respond to the emergency. However human operators conventionally receive hundreds of phone calls with different emergencies that make it difficult to reach an emergency responder efficiently.

In other instances conventional notification systems inform a user when an electronic mail e mail message was received and allows the user to read the message. Some conventional notification devices provide services that send stock updates sport scores weather alerts traffic updates or other variable information to text compatible communication devices. However the message may not arrive to the intended recipient because people can forget to carry their communication devices with them or the communication devices can fail for any variety of reasons. Conventional services can determine whether the communication device received the notification but ensuring that the intended recipient received the notification is desirable.

In still other instances a recipient can very quickly be inundated with information that the recipient is not interested in. Conventional automated notification systems notify the recipient of all e mail e.g. on a store and forward basis regardless of whether the message is unsolicited spam or an expected message. Sorting through the unwanted messages with greater efficiency is desirable.

In some conventional approaches of communication a user carries multiple communication devices. The user communicates with a combination of devices such as a pager a mobile telephone a personal digital assistant PDA a two way communication device e.g. BLACKBERRY or others. However having multiple communication devices makes it difficult to maintain each device in operating condition and affordable communication service.

In other conventional approaches text to speech TTS technology provides users the ability to retrieve e mail messages over the telephone by reading a text message to the user. However the user must call in and sift through all the messages in the user s voice mailbox so informing the user when a message has arrived is desirable.

Thus what is needed is a solution for using voice based communication to reduce dependency of text based communication and increase assurance of information reaching recipients. The solution should permit interactive voice access and retrieval of information without the limitations of conventional techniques.

The present disclosure is directed to interactive voice access and retrieval of information that reduces the dependency of text based communication. In one embodiment a method of providing an audible notification to a user is disclosed. The method includes receiving configuration data from the user. The configuration data is then used to define a rule set that specifies the audible notification to be sent to the user. At least one service is identified from the rule set that provides selected information by the user and at least one other service that provides offerings associated with the rule set. The method then monitors a network to sense a change in the selected information. The audible notification is then generated to notify the user about the change in the selected information. Finally the offerings are announced to the user which are received from at least one other service.

In another embodiment a method of interacting with a user using audible notifications is disclosed. The method includes receiving configuration data from the user to establish a rule set that handles the audible notifications to the user. The rule set is then used to identify services that provide access to selected information by the user. An information network is then monitored to access the services identified by the rule set. A trigger is generated to sense a change in the selected information. An audible notification is then generated to inform the user of the change in the selected information. The audible notification is then sent with instructions defined by the rule set. At least one other service connected to the information network is monitored to provide an offering to the user. The user is then provided an option to listen to the offering further. Finally a verbal response is retrieved from the user to confirm live communication with the user.

In still another embodiment a method of obtaining information from a user using audible interaction is disclosed. The method includes detecting a voice connection with the user. The user is then prompted to enter configuration data with selected information to be retrieved from at least one service connected to a network. The network is then monitored to sense a change in the selected information. The network is then searched to identify at least one other service that provides an offering to be previewed by the user. The selected information retrieved from the network in a first format is then converted to a second format. The second format is audible to the user. The user is then notified with an audible notification of the change in the selected information. A preview of the offering is then provided in the audible notification that is sent to the user. Finally the user is then provided an option within the audible notification to choose to listen the change in the selected information and the offering in their entirety.

In yet another embodiment a system for interacting audibly with a user to provide the user access to information on a network is disclosed. The system includes a speech recognition engine that is configured to receive verbal commands from a user. A search engine is configured to identify a first service having information selected by the user and a second service with content associated with the user. The search engine is further configured to retrieve the information and content in a first format as determined by a verbal selection made by the user. A speech processor is configured to translate the verbal commands into a rule set that determines audible notifications to be sent to the user. The speech processor is responsive to the verbal selection. Finally a speech synthesizer is coupled to the speech processor to determine an audible announcement defined by the rule set to send to the user notifying about a change in the information selected by the user and about an offering from the second service. The speech synthesizer is further configured to convert the information and the content in the first format to a second format.

The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present disclosure in order that the detailed description that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the disclosure. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiments disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present disclosure. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the technology of the disclosure as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the disclosure both as to its organization and method of operation together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood however that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present disclosure.

A detailed description is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of various embodiments. The scope of the embodiments is limited only by the claims and encompasses numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description. These details are provided solely for the purposes of example and the embodiments may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details.

In one embodiment the notifier can include components e.g. an event listener a call driver and a call flow manager that generate and provide event notifications to the user . In another embodiment the notifier can provide notifications or alerts related to scheduled event generators and unscheduled event generators . In still another embodiment triggers generated by event listener can also detect calendar events and scheduled broadcasts . In still other embodiments other triggers can detect a pager alert e mail message stock quotes traffic alerts weather alerts Amber alerts homeland security advisories voice mail message fax message online auction bid alerts or other unscheduled events.

In some examples one of the pollers and can detect activity from event generators such as receipt of an e mail message . The poller that detected the received email message updates the event database with the email notification which may include storing the email contents as well. The event listener can compare the e mail message against the user notification rules which can be stored in the event database . In other embodiments the event generators may be stored remote from the event database but may be triggered by an external source such as traffic alerts or a weather alerts . The event database can store information about the event generators and the information stored can be searched to find event generators that match the user notification rules . The notifier can query the event database . For example when an event generator from event generators is matched to a rule of the user notification rules then the notifier can provide a voice recognition unit with information of the event. The voice recognition unit can then call the user at the number specified by a notification configuration module or the rule of the user notification rules . In other embodiments the notification configuration module can provide direction or control as to how the event may be provided to the user by phone. Also the voice recognition unit can interact with the user by having the user respond to a prompt or verbal request to confirm that a person instead of an answering machine has answered the phone call. During the interaction between the voice recognition unit and the user the voice recognition unit may request that the user authenticate themselves. In another embodiment a Turing Test can be presented to the user visually or verbally in order to validate that the user received the event notification first hand. When responses from the user are deemed satisfactory the voice recognition unit can then proceed to transform text into verbal information about a first event intended for the user. The event database can then be updated to reflect a status showing that the event notification or actual message was delivered to or retrieved by the user . In still other embodiments interaction with that user can be extended to include actions by the notification system where such actions may include inserting bids based on online auction bid alerts perform stock transactions based on stock quotes

If user input is detected at block then the voice recognition unit may prompt the user for authentication information in block such as including but not limited to a personal identification number PIN typed into the keypad of mobile phone a spoken word or spoken phrase identifying the user. If the provided user authentication information is determined to be invalid in block then the user can be prompted for the authentication information again in block by repeating block through block until the authentication information is determined to be valid. The call can terminate in block . If the user is unable to authenticate him or herself then the voice recognition unit can hang up the call as depicted in block .

The voice recognition unit can attempt to reach the user later for as many times as the user has configured the notification configuration module for retries. A failed recognition can be counted as one attempt to notify the user . The notifier can have the flexibility to provide the user an option to call back at the phone number to check in with the system.

When authentication is valid in block the user can be informed of the notification event as shown in block . In one embodiment information about the event including subject matter and sender information at block can be spoken to the user . In block the voice recognition unit can wait for an input from the user . In some embodiments the user can interact with the voice recognition unit by choosing to listen to the event information skipping the event information proceeding to the next event information or hanging up the call. If the user chooses to listen to information about an event additional inputs from the user can be entered at any time during the call. In another embodiment a call can be managed by call flow manager . For example the user can choose an action that saves replays deletes skips replies proceeds or signs off from the system while the event is playing. When user input is detected or received in block the voice recognition unit can respond appropriately in block and block as necessary to speak about additional event information. At the end of the event the voice recognition unit can continue to wait for additional user inputs in block until there are no more events to narrate to the user as determined in block . When there are no more events the user can be signed out in block and the voice recognition unit can hang up.

In some embodiments the notification system can be configured to dispatch a call tree of emergency responders. For example homeland security advisories can be provided to all the emergency responders having their methods of contact entered into the user notification rules . In the event of an emergency the automated system can contact each responder e.g. user user and user concurrently and dispatch instructions for each responder in parallel. The notification system may require interaction with the user to determine if the appropriate person has received the message. Information about the message delivery can be fed back to a dispatch center which can then be displayed to a dispatcher. The dispatcher can determine how many responders are available and can stop the notification system from contacting further responders when an appropriate number have been reached. Automating the dispatching service with parallel notifications to multiple users allows the dispatcher to receive more emergency calls from those in distress and greatly reduce response times. Other examples of the notification system may include but is not limited to notifying users and law enforcement officers of when a child has been abducted in their area.

In other embodiments the notification system can be configured to manage notifications regarding personal matters. For example physicians offices can automatically remind patients of appointments and can offer the ability to reschedule. Airlines can automatically notify passengers when a flight is delayed or cancelled and can provide the ability to reschedule. Users of online dating services or any other classified advertising service can be notified when someone responds to their ad and can be provided an opportunity to perform multiple actions such as respond to the response request additional information or schedule a meeting with the respondent. In other examples financial companies can notify their customers when there is a problem with an account such as an overdraft or unusual activity on the account. Commercial sales can also make use of the notification system . For example a stock broker can automatically notify a customer when a stock of interest has dropped below a specified price and can allow the customer to purchase the stock. In another example an on line auction website can automatically notify a bidder regarding attainment of various bid objectives such as when a maximum bid has been exceeded or allow the bidder to increase their bid through the notification system .

The present disclosure can be used in many scenarios where the user is expecting an event to occur and with the accessibility to a mobile phone e.g. communication device a computing device a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a multi function voice enabled device a voice over Internet Protocol VoIP device or other mobile phones is notified of the event s occurrence. The examples presented here are not meant to limit the implementations of the disclosure in any way but are intended to further illustrate exemplary embodiments according to the present disclosure.

In some embodiments the computer system can include an input device such as a mouse or other pointing device of the like e.g. a digitizer and a keyboard or other data entry device of the like. The computer system can implement output devices including but not limited to a display and a display interface . The computer system can include input output I O devices such as a communications interface a cable and a communications path which each can be connected to a network interface card or a modem. The communications interface allows software and data to be transferred between the computer system and external devices. Some exemplary devices that are connected to the communications interface may include a modem a network interface e.g. an Ethernet card a communications port a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association PCMCIA slot and card or of the like. Software and data transferred via the communications interface are in the form of signals which may be electronic electromagnetic optical or other type of signal capable of being transferred across the communications interface using the cable . The cable links to the communications interface via the communications path . The communications path can carry electronic signals via the cable fiber optics a telephone line a radio frequency RF link or other types of communication channels.

In some embodiments computer programs may include object oriented computer programs which are stored in either the main memory or the secondary memory . In other examples the objected oriented computer programs may also be stored in a removable storage drive which generally refer to computer program products. Such computer programs when executed enable the computer system to perform features of the present disclosure as discussed herein. In particular the computer programs when executed enable the processor to perform the features of the present disclosure.

In other embodiments the disclosure is directed to a computer program product including a computer readable medium having control logic computer software stored therein. The control logic when executed by the processor causes the processor to perform the functions of the disclosure as described herein. In still other embodiments the computer software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into the computer system using the removable storage drive hard disk drive or communications interface . The computer software can run as a standalone application running atop an operating system or can be integrated into the operating system.

In still other embodiments the computer system includes one or more of processor . The processor is connected to a communication infrastructure e.g. a communications bus cross over bar or network . The computer system can include the display interface that forwards graphics text and other data from the communication infrastructure or from a frame buffer not shown for presenting on the display . The computer system can also include a main memory such as random access memory RAM with a secondary memory . The secondary memory can include either a hard disk drive or a removable storage drive which represents a floppy diskette drive a magnetic tape drive an optical disk drive a compact disk drive CD ROM or of the like. The removable storage drive either reads from or writes to a removable storage unit in a well known manner. The removable storage unit which can be referred to as a program storage device or a computer program product is accessed for reading and writing by removable storage drive . In some embodiments the removable storage unit includes a computer readable storage medium that stores computer data and instructions.

In yet another embodiment the secondary memory may include other similar devices for allowing computer programs or instructions be loaded into the computer system . For example a removable storage unit and an interface may provide an alternative storage capacity. Examples of such may include a program cartridge and cartridge interface e.g. those found in video game devices or a removable memory chip e.g. an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM programmable read only memory PROM with associated socket which allow either data or instructions to be transferred from the removable storage unit to the computer system . In some examples hardware components such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs or other integrated circuits can implement one or more portions of the computer system to provide functionality as described herein. In other examples the computer system can be implemented in a combination of both hardware and software components.

The disclosure may be used for example in conjunction with a product registration system. In one example a manufacturer may use the notification function of the present disclosure to inform registered customers of new product features product defects or recalls. Similarly customers may be notified when the warranty on a registered product is about to expire with the option to purchase extended warranty coverage.

In another example the notification function may be integrated into a voice responsive product registration system. Such a system may allow a product purchaser to call into an automated voice responsive system to register the purchased product. The purchaser may be presented with any number of questions about the product purchased product preferences personal interests or of the like. The purchaser s verbal responses may be captured and stored in a database. A response to the questions may trigger an event notification. For example if the purchaser indicates an interest in a complementary product a notification may be sent to a sales agent about the complementary product to follow up with the purchaser. In another example the purchaser may indicate an interest in features that are not yet available and a notification may be sent to the purchaser when those features become available.

In other examples the notification function may be used in conjunction with a broadcast voice notification system that may speed and simplify the notification process. The broadcast voice notification system pushes important information or notices to individual recipients with security delivery authentication and single point activation. The broadcast voice notification system s secure voice alert administration is easy and intelligent and may allow the user to select people to notify and to make choices on the fly even to monitor who has been contacted moment by moment.

The broadcast voice notification system may provide a simple web interface which may allow a phone list to be instantly created or recalled a message to be typed or pasted and sent to many people simultaneously. The broadcast voice notification system may provide a seamless broadcasting system that gets a message delivered quickly. The broadcast voice notification system may contact all the people on a list at once and reading the message to them when they answer the phone. The user who originates the message may monitor its broadcast in real time through a computer based user interface. The user interface may show if a call attempt fails and the user may then try again at the appropriate time.

A monitor mechanism monitors the location of a calling party e.g. the user . This allows the system to monitor and access the nature of the message being received and provide appropriate location sensitive or responsive services such as a 411 system and to look up numbers and provide context relevant notification e.g. location time of day user profile related or others. during an interactive call with a user. Thus the system may not require a user to hang up and thereby provide another notification but instead while monitoring the persons current session the system may provide other relevant services. So for example if a user is looking up restaurants the system can offer them a voice coupon and notify the person that for example a particular nearby restaurant is offering a special deal right now and provide an option to connect the user to the establishment and give them the coupon offer. In doing so the system may also initiate a call to that restaurant let the restaurant staff know that someone is on the line that is asking for the coupon offer and then connect the call. According to another embodiment the system may offer a voice coupon and ask the user to confirm e.g. would you like the coupon In response to an affirmative verbal reply the system may email that coupon to the user or email the user a link to where they can register to receive the coupon. According to another embodiment the system may take user registration information using a voice registration functionality to take the person s complete name address info if necessary and or pull it out of the system e.g. perform a look up . The system may further register all of that person s interests and for example put them on a mailing list to mail them a free sample of an associated product.

Returning to block the system once again looks at alerts and so again with reference to the instant example and context a user may be doing a 411 lookup for a particular area e.g. requesting weather for a particular area news based on a zip code or others. Alternatively if the system knows a person s default area it may look to see if there is an alert either based on user preferences or some sort of emergency indicated to be associated with the particular geographical area of the user. If there is an alert processing may continue at block where an appropriate voice message may be generated to the user e.g. There is a weather alert for your region would you like to hear it If they say No then the system may continue back into the interactive system allowing the user to continue retrieving news or request new information. Alternatively if the answer is Yes the weather alert is instead provided after which the user is returned back into the system. While this system of context sensitive interrupts may be provided on the web to provide context sensitive ads using various web pages embodiments of the present system may read the text based information on a web page to provide context sensitivity with voice interaction with the user being offered context sensitive mechanisms based on their location and other factors while the system is retrieving data in a voice application.

While various embodiments of the present disclosure have been described above it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only and not limitation. Thus the breadth and scope of the present disclosure should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments but should instead be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents.
