The invention described herein was made in part with government support under Grant No. R01 CA109542 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present disclosure relates to compounds and methods for inhibition of indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase further the disclosure relates to method of treatment of diseases and disorders mediated by indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase.

Tryptophan Trp is an essential amino acid required for the biosynthesis of proteins niacin and the neurotransmitter 5 hydroxytryptamine serotonin . The enzyme indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase also known as INDO or IDO catalyzes the first and rate limiting step in the degradation of L tryptophan to N formyl kynurenine. In human cells IFN y stimulation induces activation of IDO which leads to a depletion of Trp thereby arresting the growth of Trp dependent intracellular pathogens such as and . IDO activity also has an antiproliferative effect on many tumor cells and IDO induction has been observed in vivo during rejection of allogeneic tumors indicating a possible role for this enzyme in the tumor rejection process.

It has been observed that HeLa cells co cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs acquire an immunoinhibitory phenotype through up regulation of IDO activity. A reduction in PBL proliferation upon treatment with interleukin 2 IL 2 was believed to result from IDO released by the tumor cells in response to IFN y secretion by the PBLs. This effect was reversed by treatment with 1 methyl tryptophan 1MT a specific IDO inhibitor. It was proposed that IDO activity in tumor cells may serve to impair antitumor responses Logan et al. 2002 Immunology 105 478 87 .

Several lines of evidence suggest that IDO is involved in induction of immune tolerance. Studies of mammalian pregnancy tumor resistance chronic infections and autoimmune diseases have shown that cells expressing IDO can suppress T cell responses and promote tolerance. Accelerated Trp catabolism has been observed in diseases and disorders associated with cellular immune activation such as infection malignancy autoimmune diseases and AIDS as well as during pregnancy. It was proposed that IDO is induced chronically by HIV infection and is further increased by opportunistic infections and that the chronic loss of Trp initiates mechanisms responsible for cachexia dementia and diarrhea and possibly immunosuppression of AIDS patients Brown et al. 1991 Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 294 425 35 . To this end it has recently been shown that IDO inhibition can enhance the levels of virus specific T cells and concomitantly reduce the number of virally infected macrophages in a mouse model of HIV Portula et al. 2005 Blood 106 2382 90 .

IDO is believed to play a role in the immunosuppressive processes that prevent fetal rejection in utero. More than 40 years ago it was observed that during pregnancy the genetically disparate mammalian conceptus survives in spite of what would be predicted by tissue transplantation immunology Medawar 1953 Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 7 320 38 . Anatomic separation of mother and fetus and antigenic immaturity of the fetus cannot fully explain fetal allograft survival. Recent attention has focused on immunologic tolerance of the mother. Because IDO is expressed by human syncytiotrophoblast cells and systemic tryptophan concentration falls during normal pregnancy it was hypothesized that IDO expression at the maternal fetal interface is necessary to prevent immunologic rejection of the fetal allografts. To test this hypothesis pregnant mice carrying syngeneic or allogeneic fetuses were exposed to 1MT and a rapid T cell induced rejection of all allogeneic concepti was observed. Thus by catabolizing tryptophan the mammalian conceptus appears to suppress T cell activity and defends itself against rejection and blocking tryptophan catabolism during murine pregnancy allows maternal T cells to provoke fetal allograft rejection Munn et al. 1998 Science 281 1191 3 .

Further evidence for a tumoral immune resistance mechanism based on tryptophan degradation by IDO comes from the observation that most human tumors constitutively express IDO and that expression of IDO by immunogenic mouse tumor cells prevents their rejection by preimmunized mice. This effect is accompanied by a lack of accumulation of specific T cells at the tumor site and can be partly reverted by systemic treatment of mice with an inhibitor of IDO in the absence of noticeable toxicity. Thus it was suggested that the efficacy of therapeutic vaccination of cancer patients might be improved by concomitant administration of an IDO inhibitor Uyttenhove et al. 2003 Nature Med. 9 1269 74 . It has also been shown that the IDO inhibitor 1 MT can synergize with chemotherapeutic agents to reduce tumor growth in mice suggesting that IDO inhibition may also enhance the anti tumor activity of conventional cytotoxic therapies Muller et al. 2005 Nature Med. 11 312 9 .

One mechanism contributing to immunologic unresponsiveness toward tumors may be presentation of tumor antigens by tolerogenic host APCs. A subset of human IDO expressing antigen presenting cells APCs that coexpressed CD123 IL3RA and CCR6 and inhibited T cell proliferation have also been described. Both mature and immature CD123 positive dendritic cells suppressed T cell activity and this IDO suppressive activity was blocked by 1MT Munn et al. 2002 Science 297 1867 70 . It has also been demonstrated that mouse tumor draining lymph nodes TDLNs contain a subset of plasmacytoid dendritic cells pDCs that constitutively express immunosuppressive levels of IDO. Despite comprising only 0.5 of lymph node cells in vitro these pDCs potently suppressed T cell responses to antigens presented by the pDCs themselves and also in a dominant fashion suppressed T cell responses to third party antigens presented by nonsuppressive APCs. Within the population of pDCs the majority of the functional IDO mediated suppressor activity segregated with a novel subset of pDCs coexpressing the B lineage marker CD19. Thus it was hypothesized that IDO mediated suppression by pDCs in TDLNs creates a local microenvironment that is potently suppressive of host antitumor T cell responses Munn et al. 2004 J. Clin. Invest. 114 2 280 90 .

IDO degrades the indole moiety of tryptophan serotonin and melatonin and initiates the production of neuroactive and immunoregulatory metabolites collectively known as kynurenines. By locally depleting tryptophan and increasing proapoptotic kynurenines IDO expressed by dendritic cells DCs can greatly affect T cell proliferation and survival. IDO induction in DCs could be a common mechanism of deletional tolerance driven by regulatory T cells. Because such tolerogenic responses can be expected to operate in a variety of physiopathological conditions tryptophan metabolism and kynurenine production might represent a crucial interface between the immune and nervous systems Grohmann et al. 2003 Trends Immunol. 24 242 8 .

Small molecule inhibitors of IDO are being developed to treat or prevent IDO related diseases such as those described above. For example PCT Publication WO 99 29310 reports methods for altering T cell mediated immunity comprising altering local extracellular concentrations of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites using an inhibitor of IDO such as 1 methyl DL tryptophan p 3 benzofuranyl DL alanine p 3 benzo b thienyl DL alanine and 6 nitro L tryptophan Munn 1999 . Reported in WO 03 087347 also published as European Patent 1501918 are methods of making antigen presenting cells for enhancing or reducing T cell tolerance Munn 2003 . Compounds having indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase IDO inhibitory activity are further reported in WO 2004 094409 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004 0234623 is directed to methods of treating a subject with a cancer or an infection by the administration of an inhibitor of indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase in combination with other therapeutic modalities.

In light of the experimental data indicating a role for IDO in immunosuppression tumor resistance and or rejection chronic infections HIV infection AIDS including its manifestations such as cachexia dementia and diarrhea autoimmune diseases or disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and immunologic tolerance and prevention of fetal rejection in utero therapeutic agents aimed at suppression of tryptophan degradation by inhibiting IDO activity are desirable. Inhibitors of IDO can be used to activate T cells and therefore enhance T cell activation when the T cells are suppressed by pregnancy malignancy or a virus such as HIV. Inhibition of IDO may also be an important treatment strategy for patients with neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders such as depression.

Expression vectors for human indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase IDO protein were prepared by amplification of a 1219 by fragment of the sequence present in vector phIDO6His cDNA with primers 5 ggagcatgctaATGGCACACGCTATGGAAAAC 3 and 5 gagagatctACCTTCCTTCAAAAGGGATTTC 3 and cloning the SphI BglII 1213 bp fragment into pQE70 Qiagen to yield vector pQE70 hIDO. This construct adds 2 extra amino acids and a 6 Histidine tag to the C terminus of the natural human IDO protein while preserving intact the natural start codon and N terminus amino acid sequence. The amplified allele of human IDO shows two polymorphisms with respect to the sequence deposited in accession file P14902 of SwissProt database. These polymorphisms result in a P110S and E119G amino acid changes.

Plasmid pQE70 hIDO was transformed into M15 pREP4 cells Qiagen and clones were selected in LB agar plates supplemented with carbenicillin 50 g mL and kanamycin 30 g mL. Protein expression was carried out by growing an overnight culture of the M15pREP4 pQE70 hIDO clone in 100 mL LB supplemented with 100 ug mL carbenicillin 50 g mL kanamycin and 50 g mL of L tryptophan LBCKT medium . 40 mL of this culture were inoculated into 750 mL of LBCKT for 4 hours at 37 C. This culture was diluted 1 10 into LBCKT medium and cultured for another 2 hours at 37 C. until OD600 was higher than 0.8. At this point the cultures were inoculated with Hemin to 7 M and L Tryptophan to 75 g mL and incubated at 37 C. for 2 h. Induction of protein expression was carried out by supplementing the cultures with IPTG to 1 mM PMSF to 200 M EDTA to 1 mM and L tryptophan to 50 g mL. Incubation was continued for additional 16 h at 25 C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and the cell pellets were washed with PBS buffer supplemented with 200 M PMSF and 1 mM EDTA and stored at 80 C. until protein purification.

The equivalent of 16 L of culture were processed in one batch of purification. Cell pellets were thawed resuspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 200 M PMSF 1 mM EDTA 1 mg mL lysozyme to 10 mL per liter of bacterial culture and incubated 30 minutes on ice. Cells were then lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged 20 min at 20000 g and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 m filters. The filtered supernatant was loaded onto a 60 mL phosphocellulose column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 KPB at 1 3 mL min. The column was washed with 3 volumes of 50 mM KPB 3 volumes of 100 mM KPB and the protein was eluted with 15 volumes of a linear gradient of 100 500 mM KPB. Fractions were collected and IDO activity assay was performed by measuring kynurenine production. This was carried out by mixing 50 L of each fraction with 100 L of reaction mix to yield a final concentration of 50 mM KPB buffer 20 mM ascorbic acid 200 g mL catalase 20 M methylene blue and 400 M L tryptophan. Fractions demonstrating IDO activity were loaded onto a Ni NTA purification column 15 mL . This affinity purification column was washed with 10 volumes of 250 mM KPB 150 mM NaCl 50 mM imidazole pH 8 and eluted with 10 volumes of buffer containing 250 mM KPB 150 mM NaCl and a 50 to 250 mM imidazole linear gradient. Collected fractions were assayed by IDO enzymatic assay described above and the positive fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against a buffer containing 250 mM KPB 50 glycerol. This process yields 8 10 mg of pure protein 98 with a specific activity of 170 mol h mg.

The ICvalues for each compound were determined by testing the activity of IDO in a mixture containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 70 nM purified human IDO protein 200 M L tryptophan 20 mM ascorbate 20 M methylene blue 0.1 DMSO. The inhibitors were initially diluted in DMSO at 100 mM and were diluted in potassium phosphate 50 mM added to the reaction mixture at final concentrations raging from 1 mM to 5 nM and preincubated with the enzyme for 5 min at 25 C. The reaction was started by addition of L tryptophan to 200 M and incubated 15 min at 37 C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 vol of 30 trichloroacetic acid and incubated 30 min at 60 C. to hydrolyze N formylkynurenine to kynurenine. The reaction was centrifuged at 3400 g for 5 min to remove precipitated protein and the supernatant was reacted with 2 w v of p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid. The reaction was incubated 10 min at 25 C. and read at 480 nm in a spectrophotometer. Control samples with no IDO inhibitor or with no IDO enzyme or with the reference inhibitors 1 methyl tryptophan 200 M and menadione 1.2 M were used as controls to set the parameters for the non linear regressions necessary for determination of the ICfor each compound. Nonlinear regressions and determination of the ICvalues were performed using the GraphPad Prism 4 software. Compounds with an ICof less than 500 M were considered as active inhibitors in this assay.

293 T REx cells Invitrogen constitutively express a tet operator binding repressor protein and are maintained in DMEM 10 FBS 1 Penicillin Streptomycin 2 mM L glutamine 5 g mL blasticidin at 37 C. with a 5 COin air atmosphere and typically split prior to confluency. Cells were passed by splitting the culture 1 10 by removing media by aspiration washing 1 with PBS incubating with 0.25 trypsin EDTA until the cells detach disbursing the cells in fresh growth media and plating at 1 10 dilutions in fresh growth media. For long term cryopreservation cells are detached from the plate as described above collected by centrifugation resuspended in freeze medium growth medium 10 DMSO stored in 1.8 mL cyropreservation vials 2 5 106 cells per vial in liquid nitrogen vapor storage tanks

IDO1 expressing 293 T Rex cell lines were generated by stable transfection of plasmid pcDNA tetO IDO expressing human IDO or murine IDO under the control of the doxycycline inducible CMV tet promoter. Transfected cells were selected in DBZ medium DMEM 10 FBS 1 Penicillin Streptomycin 2 mM L glutamine 5 g mL blasticidin and 25 g ml Zeocin at 37 C. with a 5 COin air atmosphere. Individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution cloning from these populations. These clones were assayed for IDO activity and the clones that showed the highest levels of IDO activity inducible by doxycycline were used for subsequent cell based IDO assays.

To setup an IDO cell based activity assay IDO 293 T Rex cells were harvested and resuspended in DBZ media at 10cells mL and split into poly D lysine coated 96 well plates at 100 000 cells per well. 100 L of Neutral medium DBZ medium 200 M L tryptophan or Induction media Neutral medium supplemented with 5 M doxycycline are added to the cells and incubated 28 h at 37 C. After the IDO induction period medium is removed and replaced with Induction or Neutral medium containing different concentrations of each inhibitor 1 mM to 0.5 nM . The cells incubated in Neutral medium serve as negative control of the assay. The cells incubated in Induction medium and without inhibitor serve as the positive control of the assay. The incubation is carried out for 16 h at 37 C. in a cell culture incubator. 200 L of medium are transferred to U bottom polypropylene 96 well plates containing 25 L of 30 TCA incubated 30 minutes at 60 C. and centrifuged at 3400 g for 5 minutes. 150 L of the clear supernatant is transferred to a polystyrene 96 well plate containing 50 L of 4 w v of p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid incubated for 10 min. Kynurenine concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance at 480 nm.

To measure the toxicity of each compound after 16 h incubation with cells cell viability is measured via a WST 1 assay Roche according to instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly after the incubation with each compound medium is aspirated and replaced with 100 mL of WST 1 reagent and incubated 30 min at 37 C. Absorbance at 540 nm is correlated with the number of viable cells. Determination of IC Kynurenine assay or LD WST 1 assay is performed via non linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software.

Human monocytes were collected from peripheral mononuclear cells by leukoapheresis and cultured overnight at 10cells well in a 96 well plate in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum and 2 mM L glutamine. Adherent cells were retained and cultured for 7 days with 200 ng ml IL 4 100 ng ml GM CSF. Cells were matured for 2 days with a cytokine cocktail containing TNF IL 1 IL 6 and PGE2 for additional 2 days to induce dendritic cell maturation. At the end of maturation loosely adherent cells were detached by gentle aspiration and plated in V bottom 96 well plates at 5000 cells well. These cells are 80 IDO dendritic cells. Human allogeneic T cells 3 10 from normal donors were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 200 U mL IL 2 and 100 ng mL anti CD3 antibody and added to the wells. Serial dilutions of IDO compounds dissolved in phenol red free RPMI was added to yield a final concentration of IDOi between 500 and 1 M. After incubation for 2 4 days T cell proliferation was measured by BrdU incorporation assay after an overnight pulse with BrdU labeling mix Roche Molecular Biochemicals . At the en of the pulse the cells were fixed and incubated with 100 L well anti BrdU POD antibody following the instructions from the manufacturer. Plates were read in a microplate reader.

Alternatively testing of IDO inhibitors in an in vitro mouse model of IDO mediated suppression of T cell proliferation is performed by the following procedure. C57b16 mice are inoculated with 1 10B78H1 GMCSF tumor cells in the right flank. After 10 12 days tumor draining lymph nodes are collected and cells are stained with anti CD11c and anti B220 monoclonal antibodies. Cells are sorted by high speed fluorescence activated cell sorting and the CD11c B220 plasmacytoid dendritic cells are collected and seeded at 2000 cells well in 96 well V bottom plates. Splenocytes are collected from BM3 transgenic mice in CBA background and collected by nylon wool enrichment. BM3 T cells 10cells well are added to each well in 200 L of RPMI 10 FCS 50 M P mercaptoetanol. Alternatively T cells are obtained from spleens of OT I transgenic mice and added to the culture in combination with OVA peptide. IDO inhibitors are added dissolved in RPMI at final concentrations ranging from 1 mM to 10 nM. After 3 days of stimulation cells are pulsed by 16 h with BrdU or H thymidine. Cells are collected fixed and tested for BrdU incorporation following the instructions from the BrdU labeling kit manufacturer Roche Diagnostics . If H tymidine is used to measure T cell proliferation cells are harvested and dpm counts are measured in a scintillation counter following procedures widely known in the art. Control CD11c cells taken from the contralateral lymph node or CD11c B220 cells IDO population from the TDLN are used as positive control for proliferation.

In vivo anti tumor efficacy can be tested using modified tumor allograft protocols. For instance it has been described in the literature that IDO inhibition can syngerize with cytotoxic chemotherapy in immune competent mice. Due to different susceptibilities of different tumor cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs and to immune mediated rejection each IDO inhibitor is tested alone and in combination with 2 different chemotherapeutic drugs in 4 different animal tumor models represented by 4 different mouse tumor cell lines of different tissue origin colorectal bladder mammary and lung carcinoma implanted subcutaneously in syngeneic strains of mice. These cell lines have been selected based on their known susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs their partial response to IDO inhibitors as single agents their presumed pattern of IDO expression according to their tissue of origin and their ability to elicit an immune reaction.

For every animal tumor model 2 different chemotherapeutic drugs are tested in separate groups of mice according to the following list 1 LLC tumor cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel 2 EMT6 tumor cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel 3 CT26 tumor cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin and 4 MB49 tumor cyclophosphamide and gemcitabine.

The following chemotherapeutic drugs are used at the indicated doses. The maximum tolerated dose for the following chemotherapeutic agents in mice depends on the formulation concentration frequency of administration route of administration and number of doses. The chemotherapeutic drugs administered in conjunction with each IDO inhibitor drug are 1 Paclitaxel 20 mg kg day i.p every 4 days 4 times q4dx4 in Cremophor 2 Doxorubicin 5 mg kg once a week for 3 weeks q7dx3 3 Cyclophosphamide 100 mg kg I.P. every 4 days 4 times q4dx4 4 Gemcitabine 80 mg kg every 4 days 4 times i.p. q4dx4 .

All animals receive a subcutaneous injection of a tumor forming dose of live tumor cells 50000 1000000 cells suspended in 0.1 mL of PBS or saline on day 1. Subcutaneous injection forms a localized tumor that allows monitoring tumor growth over time.

To mimic the effect of IDO inhibitor drugs as therapeutic compositions administration of IDO inhibitor drugs begins at day 5 8 after tumor inoculation. Dosing route of administration dosing frequency varies depending on the toxicity and pharmacokinetics profile of each drug. Duration of the treatment is 2 weeks. Most preferably drug is administered continuously via oral gavage or dissolution in the drinking water. Alternatively subcutaneous slow release pellets containing 100 mg of each drug are implanted under the skin by surgical procedure. IDO inhibitor drug are administered at the maximum tolerated dose or at a concentration corresponding to the LD.
