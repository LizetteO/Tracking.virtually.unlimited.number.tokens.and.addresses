title: Multiple cache directories
abstract: A first portion of an identifier can be used to assign the identifier to a slot in a first directory. The identifier can identify a cache unit in a cache. It can be determined whether assignment of the identifier to the slot in the first directory will result in the identifier and one or more other identifiers being assigned to the same slot in the first directory. If so, then the technique can include (1) using a second portion of the identifier to assign the identifier to a slot in a second directory; and (2) assigning the one or more other identifiers to one or more slots in the second directory. In addition, it can be determined whether a directory in a cache lookup data structure includes more than one pointer. If not, then a parent pointer that points to the subject directory can be removed.
