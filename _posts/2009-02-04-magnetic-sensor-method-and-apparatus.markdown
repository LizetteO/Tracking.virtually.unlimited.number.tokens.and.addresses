title: Magnetic sensor method and apparatus
abstract: A magnetic field sensing device comprising at least one magnetic sensor attached to a base structure, rotating member; and at least one flux concentrator mounted on the rotating member; whereby as the rotating member turns, the at least one flux concentrator shields the magnetic sensor so as to modulate the output of the at least one magnetic sensor. A second embodiment comprises a rotating member that rotates about an axis with at least one flux concentrator positioned thereon having a longitudinal axis in the radial direction of the rotating member; and at least one vector-type magnetic sensor fixedly mounted in the near proximity to the axis of the rotating member such that the magnetic field detected is modulated due to the rotation of the rotating member. Optionally, at least one fixed flux concentrator may be positioned along the periphery of the rotating member so as to increase magnetic flux input.
