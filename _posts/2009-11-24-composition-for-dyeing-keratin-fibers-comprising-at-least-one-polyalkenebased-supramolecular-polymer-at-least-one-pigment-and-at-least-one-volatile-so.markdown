This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 118 028 filed Nov. 26 2008 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This application also claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to French Patent Application No. FR 0857936 filed Nov. 24 2008 the contents of which are also incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates to a composition for dyeing keratin fibers for example human keratin fibers such as the hair or the eyelashes comprising at least one polyalkene based supramolecular polymer at least one pigment and at least one volatile solvent wherein the weight ratio of the at least one polyalkene based supramolecular polymer to the at least one pigment has a value greater than 0.25.

In the keratin fiber dyeing field it is already known practice to dye keratin fibers by various techniques using direct dyes for nonpermanent colorations or dye precursors for permanent colorations.

Nonpermanent dyeing or direct dyeing consists in dyeing the keratin fibers with dye compositions containing direct dyes. These dyes may be colored or coloring molecules that have an affinity for keratin fibers. They may be applied to the keratin fibers for a period of time necessary to obtain the desired coloration and then rinsed off.

The conventional dyes that may be used are for example nitrobenzene anthraquinone nitropyridine azo xanthene acridine azine or triarylmethane dyes or natural dyes.

Some of these dyes can be used under lightening conditions thereby making it possible to obtain visible colorations on dark hair.

It is also known practice to dye keratin fibers permanently by oxidation dyeing. This dyeing technique consists in applying to the keratin fibers a composition containing dye precursors such as oxidation bases and couplers. Under the action of an oxidizing agent these precursors will form at least one colored substance in the hair.

The variety of molecules used as oxidation bases and couplers allows a wide range of colors to be obtained and the colorations resulting therefrom are generally permanent strong and resistant to external agents for example to light bad weather washing perspiration and rubbing.

In order to be visible on dark hair these two dyeing techniques may require prior or simultaneous bleaching of the keratin fibers. This bleaching step carried out with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or persalts may result in appreciable degradation of the keratin fibers which may impair their cosmetic properties. The hair then may have a tendency to become coarse more difficult to disentangle and or more brittle.

Another dyeing method consists in using pigments. Specifically the use of pigment at the surface of keratin fibers generally makes it possible to obtain visible colorations on dark hair since the surface pigment masks the natural color of the fiber.

The colorations obtained via this dyeing method may have the drawback of being removed as soon as the first shampooing operation.

Thus the present disclosure relates to a composition for dyeing keratin fibers for example human keratin fibers such as the hair or the eyelashes which may make it possible to obtain colored coatings that are fast with respect to shampoo and or to the various attacks to which the hair may be subjected without degrading the keratin fibers and or while keeping the hairs perfectly individualized.

Accordingly disclosed herein is a composition for dyeing keratin fibers for example human keratin fibers such as the hair or the eyelashes comprising at least one polyalkene based supramolecular polymer at least one pigment and at least one volatile solvent wherein the weight ratio of the at least one supramolecular polymer to the at least one pigment is greater than 0.25 for example ranging from 0.3 to 20 or for example from 0.4 to 10 or for example from 0.5 to 5.

The compositions in accordance with the present disclosure may make it possible to obtain on keratin fibers colored coatings that make it possible to obtain a shampoo fast visible coloration on all hair types for example on dark hair while at the same time preserving the physical qualities of the keratin fiber. Such a coating may be for example resistant to the external attacks to which the hair may be subjected such as blow drying and perspiration. It may make it possible for example to obtain a smooth uniform deposit. Moreover it has been observed surprisingly that the hairs may remain individualized and may be styled without problems.

As used herein the term individualized hairs is intended to mean hairs which after application of the composition and drying are not stuck together or are all separate from one another and therefore do not form clumps of hair since the coating is formed around virtually every hair.

Another aspect of the present disclosure is also a process for dyeing keratin fibers for example human keratin fibers such as the hair or the eyelashes using this composition.

One aspect of the present disclosure is also the use of this composition for obtaining a colored coating on the hair.

In all of these formulae it is understood that at least one for example one or two of the Rand or Rgroups is a single bond constituting the point of attachment of the at least one group capable of forming at least three H bonds on the residue of the at least one graft.

For example the point of attachment can be carried by Rand or R and in at least one embodiment it is carried by R.

The presence of a catalyst may promote the obtaining of the desired final product. Mention may be made for example of the use of dibutyltin dilaurate.

The reaction can be monitored by infrared spectroscopy by monitoring the disappearance of the peak characteristic of the isocyanate between 2200 and 2300 cm.

At the end of the reaction ethanol can be added to the reaction medium in order to neutralize the residual isocyanate functions. The reaction mixture can optionally be filtered. For application needs the polymer may be directly stripped in a cosmetic solvent.
