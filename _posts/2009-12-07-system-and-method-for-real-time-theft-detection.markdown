The present invention is directed towards automated identification of devices. More particularly the present invention provides theft detection of portable devices using radio frequency identification.

Portable devices are being widely used for storing manipulating and exchanging data. A portable device can be an intelligent or unintelligent device based on the presence or absence of data processing capability in the device. Examples of an intelligent portable device includes but are not limited to portable audio player portable video player smartphone mobile phone laptop and Personal Digital Assistant PDA . Further examples of unintelligent portable device include but are not limited to document wallet bag id card. The portable devices may be expensive in nature and may carry confidential and important data and are therefore prone to theft.

Several technologies exist to detect occurrence of theft of portable devices using Radio Frequency Identification RFID . For example in large retail stores shelf based anti theft systems are implemented where portable products are coupled with RFID tags whereas RFID readers are placed in doorways and windows of the store. When one or more products are stolen from the store an RFID reader sends an alert to the Emergency Alert System EAS system of the store. However the shelf based antitheft system is limited to theft detection of portable devices present in an RFID enabled location. The existing RFID systems do not provide a mechanism of real time theft detection of a portable device carried by a mobile user in a location which is not secured by an RFID system.

Further technologies exist to detect occurrence of theft of portable devices without using RFID. One such technology is use of anti theft cables and locks. The security cables and locks provide theft detection for portable devices such as iPods. Another technology includes pairing a wireless device with a mobile phone. When the mobile phone disassociates from the wireless device the wireless device prompts a user to enter an authentication code thereby alarming the user regarding separation of the mobile phone. However the above mentioned technologies are limited to theft detection of specific devices. These technologies are not applicable to a wide range of intelligent and unintelligent portable devices.

In light of the abovementioned disadvantages there is a need for a system and method that facilitates real time theft detection of a wide range of portable devices carried by a user.

The present invention would now be discussed in context of embodiments as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

In an embodiment of the present invention the system comprises an enclosure comprising a portable device with processing capability and an RFID reader with an antenna . Examples of a portable device with processing capability may be electronic devices such as mobile phones PDA s laptops digital watch smartphones and the like. These devices have an internal capability for processing information. An RFID reader is a device that tracks objects by emitting radio signals using an antenna. The radio signals scan and detect an RFID tag which is coupled to an object to be tracked. An RFID tag is a microchip with an antenna which picks up the radio signals transmitted by the RFID reader and returns additional data back to the reader that is used for identification. The system comprises a wearable band hosting an RFID tag . In various embodiments of the present invention the wearable band can be custom made to fit on arm neck or waist of a user of the portable device .

The RFID reader and the RFID tag on the wearable band operate in a given frequency range. An example of the frequency range of operation is 

In various embodiments of the present invention hardware provisions may be required in the portable device and the wearable band . Examples of provisions in the portable device include but are not limited to presence on the system bus memory mapped registers interrupt line circuit space on existing printed circuit board and the like. Examples of provisions in the wearable band include but are not limited to a battery operated alarm circuit integrated with the tag.

The RFID reader interrogates the tag on the wearable band for short time period and then sleeps. These intervals may be called as a Sweep Interval T and a Sleep Interval T respectively. In an embodiment of the present invention if the portable device is not found in the vicinity of the wearable band during T pertinent actions may be taken on the portable device or the wearable band to inform a user of the portable device . In an example a pertinent action may include setting off the alarm in an alarm circuit integrated with the RFID tag of the wearable band . In various embodiments of the present invention software provisions required in the portable device for taking a pertinent action may include but are not limited to a programmable time service an application programming interface or firmware for controlling the features of the portable device and a pertinent user interface.

In various embodiments of the present invention multiple portable devices may be protected by providing multiple tags in the wearable band . The tracking of the multiple portable devices may be done by storing a lookup table in the wearable band software for mapping device models with the wearable band .

The RFID reader in the wearable band interrogates the RFID tag for short time period and then sleeps. These intervals may be called a Sweep Interval T and a Sleep Interval T respectively. In an embodiment of the present invention if the portable device is not found in the vicinity of the wearable band during T pertinent actions may be taken on the wearable band to inform a user of the portable device . In an example a pertinent action may include setting off the alarm in an alarm circuit integrated with the wearable band . In another example a pertinent action may be alerting the user of the portable device by a visual display in the wearable band .

In various embodiments of the present invention additional hardware and software provisions are included in the system for proper operation of theft detection. The provisions include but are not limited to providing on the wearable band a battery operated reader and alarm circuit a display unit in the user interface of the wearable band a programmable time service and an application programming interface or firmware for controlling the features of the wearable band .

T PAWN is Tag PAWN. R PAWN is stored on the RFID reader and T PAWN is stored on the RFID tag. During each T the RFID reader fetches T PAWN and compares with R PAWN and takes pertinent actions upon mismatch.

In various embodiments of the present invention in order to facilitate large number of pairs of portable artifacts and wearable bands sufficient bit width is allocated to R PAWN and T PAWN. As shown in the figure the packet format for the R PAWN T PAWN combination includes the following an Artifact Class Number ACN an Artifact Number AN an Error Resilience ER a wearable band class number WCN and a wearable band number WN . The ACN number is an 8 bit number used to accommodate various classes of portable artifacts. The AN number is a 120 bit number used to uniquely identify a portable artifact per portable artifact class. The ER is a 2 bit number used for selective error correction mechanism. The WCN is an 8 bit number used to accommodate various classes of wearable band corresponding to various classes of portable artifacts. The WN is a 120 bit number used to uniquely identify a given wearable band per wearable band class.

In an embodiment of the present invention when the reader fetches the T PAWN from the RFID tag and decodes the ER bit of the packet various error correction bits are discarded after the error correction operation is over. In an example if ER 0 the bit positions used for error correction as per hamming code are not treated as hamming bits and are neglected.

As shown in the figure EET CURRENT is obtained at the start of Tand the EET FINAL is measured when the theft condition is marked the difference of two time values EET TOTAL is then compared to a FAT or False Alarm Threshold value. In an example If EET TOTAL exceeds the FAT value then it indicates that the wearable band has remained outside the region of interest for a time period greater than the FAT value. Consequently this indicates that the permissible false alarm threshold has been surpassed. In an embodiment of the present invention the RFID tag has a default UID which is stored in non erasable area of memory. This facilitates in countering replay attacks wherein the attacker may be able to capture all static data from the RFID tag by way of interrogating the tag on portable device or wearable band side but will not be able to replay the default UID from a particular location of memory using a rogue tag. In an example UID containing additional vendor specific information combined with requirement of fetching data from particular memory location can be used as deterrence against such attacks.

At step a RFID tag is interrogated during successive sleep intervals. In various embodiments of the present invention the RFID tag is interrogated by a RFID reader. The RFID reader is configured to interrogate the RFID tag for a short preset time period i.e. sweep interval. The RFID reader interrogates the RFID tag to fetch information related to the one or more portable devices and corresponding wearable band pair. The wearable band is adapted to be worn by user of the portable devices.

At step one or more pairing information is received. In various embodiments of the present invention one or more pairing information are allocated to each pair of the one or more portable devices and wearable band to uniquely identify a portable device with a wearable band and vice versa. In an embodiment of the present invention the one or more pairing information may include a unique identifier e.g. a User Identification UID which corresponds to vendor specific information associated with RFID reader and the wearable band. In another embodiment of the present invention the one or more pairing information may include a unique number that is allocated to each portable device wearable band pair. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the unique number allocated to the RFID reader may be referred as Reader Portable Artifact and Wearable Band number R PAWN . In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention the unique number allocated to the RFID tag may be referred as Tag Portable Artifact and Wearable Band number T PAWN .

At step a check is performed to determine if the pairing information matches with pairing information stored in the RFID reader. In an embodiment of the present invention the UID received from the RFID tag is compared with UID stored in the RFID reader. In another embodiment of the present invention the T PAWN received from the RFID tag is compared with the R PAWN stored in the RFID reader.

At step if it is determined that the one or more pairing information does not match to the one or more corresponding information an alert signal is generated. In various embodiments of the present invention if the UID received from the RFID tag matches with the UID stored in the RFID reader the T PAWN is fetched from the RFID tag. The T PAWN is then compared with the R PAWN stored in the RFID reader. In case the T PAWN does not match with the R PAWN an alert signal is generated. In an embodiment of the present invention alert signal is generated by triggering an alarm system in the wearable band or by displaying theft information in a display unit provided in the wearable band or provided in a portable device with processing capability.

In another embodiment of the present invention an alert signal is generated via the wearable band or the one or more portable devices when the RFID tag fails to respond to the RFID reader. In a further embodiment of the present invention a check is performed to ensure that a false alarm is not triggered. When the RFID tag fails to respond to the interrogation signal emitted by the RFID receiver a first time value is measured at the start of the sweep interval. Further when the one or more pairing information does not match with the one or more pairing information stored in the RFID reader a second time interval is measured. A difference is then calculated between the second time value and the first time value to obtain a third time value. The third time value is compared with a predetermined false alarm threshold value. If the third value exceeds the predetermined false alarm threshold an alert signal is generated.

If it is determined that the one or more pairing information matches with the one or more corresponding information then at step the RFID reader enters into a sleep interval. In various embodiments of the present invention a sleep interval is established between successive sweep intervals. The sleep interval represents inactive state of the RFID reader. Steps to are then repeated.

In an embodiment of the present invention if the RFID device is found to be invalid then at step an error flag is set confirming the presence of an invalid device. In another embodiment of the present invention at step the RFID device firmware data is obtained by the system. Thereafter all CRX devices are enumerated at step and at step a CRX device is selected and its parameters are obtained.

Subsequently the sweep count is read at step and at step a counter is started for the time duration of the sweep count being more than zero. Thereafter at step the time elapsed between the start of the sweep interval and initiation of communication with the RFID tag is calculated. At step if the time elapsed is greater than the sweep interval then at step it is checked whether the read toggle is on. In an embodiment if the read toggle is on then at step upon initiation of communication with the RFID tag data is read from the tag and the ID obtained is compared with the stored UID. Thereafter at step the read toggle is set off. At step the fields T PAWN WN WCN AN ACN are extracted and hamming error check is done. After computing the time elapsed at step the sleep interval is set and the device is closed at step .

The present invention may be implemented in numerous ways including as a system a method or a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network wherein programming instructions are communicated from a remote location.

While the exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described and illustrated herein it will be appreciated that they are merely illustrative. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications in form and detail may be made therein without departing from or offending the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
