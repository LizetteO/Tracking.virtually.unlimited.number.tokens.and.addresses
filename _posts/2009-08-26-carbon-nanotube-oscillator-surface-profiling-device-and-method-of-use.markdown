Carbon nanotubes CNT are quasi one dimensional structures which are obtained by rolling up graphene sheets into cylinders. There are single wall carbon nanotubes consisting of one sheet and multi wall carbon nanotubes consisting of two or more concentric cylindrical sheets. The particular way of graphene rolling is characterized by a chirality index n m which determines if the rolled graphene is metallic or semiconducting. In addition CNT can have diameters in the range of 0.5 1.5 nm and lengths up to several micrometers.

CNTs have received much attention due to their potential applications as integrated nanoscale elements in various devices. Low friction low wear multi wall CNT bearings have been demonstrated. Prior work in the art has shown that if an inner tube from a double wall nanotube is extruded with respect to the stationary outer tube the inner tube can easily slide or rotate due to the intertube van der Waals vdW interaction. Such devices have been reported to have very low friction at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the vdW forces.

Scanning probe microscopes such as the Atomic Force Microscope AFM are examples of scanning probe imaging and sensing devices. These devices are useful for surface profiling. A non contact AFM measures the microscopic surface profile of a near planar target using a nanometer scale probe that is mounted at the end of a tiny cantilever. Deflection of the cantilever as the probe is raster scanned across the surface of the target is optically measured. The measurements are used to establish a profile of the target surface. However the resolution of the AFM is limited by the probe tip radius which is on the order of a few tens of nanometers.

Accordingly what is needed in the art is a non contact surface profiling device that provides an improved resolution over the AFM systems currently known in the art.

In accordance with the present invention a CNT oscillator is proposed to be used as a surface profiling device. The CNT oscillator will provide an improved resolution over an atomic force microscope AFM tip operating in non contact mode. The carbon nanotube oscillator in accordance with the present invention can achieve in plane resolution 1 nm as compared to 20 30 nm in plane resolution for typical atomic force microscope AFM tips known in the art.

This invention proposes to use a finite length double wall carbon nanotube CNT oscillator consisting of an outer stationary and an inner oscillating tube as a surface profiling device. The idea of the device is supported by two facts. First the frequency of oscillations of the inner tube depends strongly on the distance between the CNT and the surface. Second the frequency of oscillations is determined by a small region located around the diameter of the oscillating tube. The operation of the device is the following. The CNT is brought in the vicinity of a surface with an unknown roughness. The axis of the CNT is perpendicular to the plane of the surface. The frequency of oscillations is recorded. The surface is moved at a distance corresponding to the small region determining the frequency. This is done in such a way as to keep the nanotube axis perpendicular to the surface plane. The frequency of oscillations is recorded again. This process is repeated as many times as an operator requires. This process allows for profiling the roughness of the surface since the frequency of oscillations depends strongly on the distance between the CNT and the surface.

In a particular embodiment the present invention provides a method for profiling a sample surface which includes positioning an open ended double wall carbon nanotube oscillator in close proximity to a sample surface such that the axis of the carbon nanotube oscillator is substantially perpendicular to a sample surface the carbon nanotube oscillator comprising a stationary carbon nanotube having a first length and a first interior diameter and an oscillatory carbon nanotube positioned within the interior of the stationary carbon nanotube the oscillatory carbon nanotube having a second length and a second interior diameter that is smaller than the first interior diameter. The oscillation of the oscillatory carbon nanotube is then initiated and the frequency of oscillation of the oscillatory carbon nanotube is measured. The method further includes re positioning the carbon nanotube oscillator at a plurality of locations perpendicular to the sample surface re initiating the oscillation of the oscillatory carbon nanotube and re measuring the frequency of oscillation at each of the plurality of locations to profile the sample surface.

The oscillation of the oscillatory carbon nanotube can be initiated by extruding the oscillatory carbon nanotube from the stationary carbon nanotube along the common axis of the stationary and oscillator carbon nanotubes to a first distance from a first edge of the stationary carbon nanotube and then releasing the oscillatory carbon nanotube to initiate the oscillation.

In a particular embodiment measuring the frequency of the oscillation of the oscillatory carbon nanotube includes positioning a laser at a first edge distal from the sample surface of the stationary carbon nanotube the laser to emit a laser beam and positioning a laser detector at a first edge distal from the sample surface of the stationary carbon nanotube and in line with the laser the detector to measure the intensity of the laser beam emitted by the laser as the oscillatory tube oscillates.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a system for profiling a sample surface is provided. The system includes an open ended double wall carbon nanotube oscillator comprising a stationary carbon nanotube having a first length and a first interior diameter and an oscillatory carbon nanotube positioned within the interior of the stationary carbon nanotube the oscillatory carbon nanotube having a second length and a second interior diameter that is smaller than the first interior diameter and a laser detector positioned at a first edge distal from a sample surface of the stationary carbon nanotube the laser detector for measuring the frequency of oscillation of the oscillatory carbon nanotube.

In a particular embodiment the system utilizes an electrostatic telescoping device to extrude the oscillatory carbon nanotube from the stationary carbon nanotube by an initial extrusion distance to initiate the oscillation of the oscillatory carbon nanotube.

In a specific embodiment the laser detector includes a laser to emit a laser beam and a laser detector positioned in line with the laser the detector to measure the intensity of the laser beam emitted by the laser as the oscillatory tube oscillates.

The proposed device is based on a carbon nanotube oscillator consisting of a finite length outer stationary nanotube and a finite length inner oscillating nanotube. Its main function is to measure changes in the characteristics of the motion of the carbon nanotube oscillating near a sample surface and profile the roughness of this surface. The device operates in a non contact mode thus it can be virtually non wear and non fatigued system. The carbon nanotube oscillator in accordance with the present invention can achieve in plane resolution 1 nm as compared to 20 30 nm in plane resolution for typical atomic force microscope AFM tips known in the art. Finally the double wall carbon nanotube oscillator can be achieved even if the tubes have mechanical imperfections in their structure which makes it economically desirable.

Consider an open ended double wall CNT consisting of inner and outer tubes with radii Rand R and with lengths 2Land 2L respectively. Let the carbon bonds at the ends be saturated to prevent chemical reaction with the environment. Let the outer tube be stationary and the inner one be extruded from the outer one along their common axis at some initial distance. This can be done for example by electrostatically telescoping the inner tube using procedures currently known in the art. The inner tube is released and due to the mutual van der Waals vdW force between the ends of the inner and outer tube the tube can oscillate in time. This case is referred to as free oscillation .

The proposed invention involves a double wall CNT oscillator brought within a close proximity to an infinite sample with thickness L. The general configuration is such that the axis of the tube is perpendicular to the sample surface as shown in . The inner tube is extruded from the outer one at some initial position s and then released from rest. The motion of the inner tube is oscillatory again but it has different characteristics as compared to the free oscillation case. The operation of the device is determined by the forces governing the motion. In this case they are the vdW force in the double wall CNT and the vdW between the CNT and the sample. In addition there is a friction force between the surface and the moving tube due to tube surface dissipation processes. The motion of the inner tube is oscillatory again but it has different characteristics as compared to the free oscillation case. For the free oscillation the inner tube will oscillate between s and s. When the sample is present the oscillation will be between s and z s where zis determined by the repulsive part of the vdW interaction between the tube and the sample and the dissipation force. This in turn will cause changes in the oscillation motion as compared to the free oscillation motion.

To examine the motion of the inner tube from the vdW interactions in the system are describes. For this purpose the pairwise additive Lennard Jones LJ type of vdW potential for extended systems is adopted. The LJ approach has been widely used in calculating the vdW interaction in carbon structures because of its relative simplicity and satisfactory results when compared with experimental data. It is found that the LJ vdW potential is suitable for parallel single walled CNT multiwall CNTs fullerenes inside single walled CNTs and radially deformed single and multiwall CNTs. Also the LJ model has been applied in calculating the oscillatory frequency and describing the characteristic behavior of various CNT oscillator systems.

The total LJ vdW potential and consequently the vdW force in the system consists of adding the contributions from the interaction between the inner and outer tubes between the inner tube and the sample and between the outer tube and the sample. The motion of the inner tube is affected only by the first two contributions thus the interaction between the outer tube and the sample is not considered here.

 and are the azimuthal angles for each tube shown in . Equation 3 can be further simplified by performing the integrals over the angular variables giving the result 

The corresponding coordinates for the inner tube are given by Eq. 5 and for the sample are cos sin 10 

In this model it is assumed that the forces responsible for the energy dissipation processes between the tubes are negligible compared to the vdW force. This assumption is supported by the fact that the friction between the nanotubes is at least two orders of magnitude less than the vdW interaction. In addition the structure parameters such as the chiral combination of the tubes their radii and lengths and the initial extrusion of the mobile tube can be chosen in such a way as to further minimize the inter tube energy dissipation and to make the oscillatory motion dynamically stable. Also experimental measurements have shown that even defective oscillating tubes maintain their ultralow friction.

The presence of the sample is another source of energy loss in the oscillatory motion. In fact the oscillating tube near an infinite surface is an example of a system with non contact friction. The origin of such friction has been related to vdW interactions to the creation of collective excitations such as phonons or to the spatial variation of the surface potential when an external voltage bias is applied. As a result there is damping associated with a friction force F m v where m is the mass of the object v is the velocity and is the friction coefficient. Much effort has been devoted in calculating due to the various forces. Using the results for summarized in the most recent review it is found that the dominant contribution to the friction is determined when the oscillating tube is in the close vicinity of the equilibrium position of the tube with respect to the surface. In this case the tube creates stress which excites acoustic waves on the sample. Calculations of the friction parameter due to this phenomenon were done in studies related to non contact atomic force microscopy molecule adsorbates on surfaces and Brownian motion of molecules on surfaces. The vdW interaction itself between the tube and the surface can also give rise to friction. However for a cylindrical object 1 d it is estimated that in this case Fis even smaller than the intertube friction.

Therefore in the present invention the friction force in the system is mainly due to the excitations of acoustic waves in the sample when the oscillating tube comes close to the surface and it is described by the following phenomenological expression 13 where m is the mass of the moving tube and is the appropriate friction coefficient. z is the Heaviside step function with z t being the displacement of the inner tube along the z axis. The friction is effective only within the region described by a cut off distance z 5 from the vdW barrier from the sample.

Then the motion of the inner tube as a function time is described by the second Newton s law as 14 where dz t dt umlaut over z dz t dt.

The results from the calculations for the nanotube oscillator system from are involve obtaining the potential from Eq. 2 governing the motion of the inner tube the vdW force corresponding to this potential and solving the equation of motion from Eq. 14 . In all numerical calculations shown here the sample is taken to be semi infinite L . Also its volume atomic density nis taken to have the same numerical value as the surface atomic density for the CNT. Choosing a finite width of the sample or another value for the atomic density does not change qualitatively the oscillatory behavior of the system described below.

In a particular embodiment a double wall 5 0 7 9 carbon nanotube with corresponding radii R 1.95 and R 5.44 and the common z axis perpendicular to the sample surface as shown in is used. The tubes are chosen to have the same lengths 2L 2L 70 . The oscillation is initiated by pulling out the inner tube to an initial extrusion position s from the stationary outer tube and releasing it from rest.

In this exemplary embodiment this particular double wall CNT was chosen due to the following reasons. First recent MD simulation studies have shown that the energy dissipation in incommensurate systems is lower than the energy dissipation in commensurate ones. This is an incommensurate system. Second the difference in the 5 0 7 9 radii is 3.5 which is very similar to the required 3.4 radial difference for a dynamically stable motion according. In order to avoid the off axial rocking motion and thus further reduce the energy dissipation in the system the extrusion length must not exceed 30 of the total tube length. Here the initial extrusion length is taken to be s 7.5 which is approximately 11 of the total tube length. The excess energy of the moving tube corresponding to the extrusion of 7.5 is E 10.5 meV atom.

The vdW potential of the inner tube is calculated according to Eqs. 2 6 11 and it is shown in for several locations of the semi infinite sample with respect to the edge of the fixed outer tube. The potential for the free oscillation is also shown indicating that the motion of the tube is between 7.5 and 7.5 in this case. shows that when the sample is at d 11.5 the potential of the oscillating tube in the region z 7.5 7.5 is the same as the one for the free oscillation. For d

The corresponding vdW force acting on the moving tube is calculated using F dV dz. The results are shown in . One sees that for the free oscillation the force has a constant value region F 0.62 nN followed by a linear region and again by a constant value region F 0.62 nN . When the sample is at d

The main contribution to the value of the numerical integration of the vdW potential due to the sample surface Eq. 11 is also examined. It is found that for all d it is determined primarily by a rather localized circular region from the sample with radius r 5R 1 nm. The rest of the surface sample contributes less than 1 to the numerical integration of Eq. 11 . Thus the vdW interaction and consequently the oscillatory behavior of the nanotube oscillator are determined mainly by a relatively limited circular region of the sample.

The vdW potential and force for other double wall nanotube oscillating systems have been calculated. These include nanotubes with different chiralities lengths and extrusions. In all cases the main contribution to the tube surface interaction comes from a localized region from the sample with r 5R. Also the vdW potential and force have similar shapes as the ones shown in . However the absolute value of the minimum of V maximum of F decreases for longer tubes and the linear regions for V and F extend over larger distances for larger extrusions.

The CNT motion in terms of its displacement and velocity as a function of time is obtained by solving Eq. 14 numerically which involves the coefficient describing the friction due to the acoustic wave excitations in the sample. To estimate the analytical expression for the coefficient of friction of an oscillating molecule near a surface is used 

A particular embodiment utilizes 5 0 7 9 double wall nanotube with lengths 2L 2L 150 where the initial extrusion is s 30 which corresponds to 20 of the initial tube length. The excess vdW energy is E 18 eV. In this case the vdW force due to the infinite surface sample affects the motion of the inner tube if 0 d 35 . illustrates the displacement of the moving tube along the z axis as a function of time for different values of the friction coefficient . The distance between the sample and the edge of the outer tube is taken to be d 15 . illustrates how zchanges in time for three values of the friction parameter when the outer tube is at d 15 from the surface.

The time dependence of zand the corresponding velocity v for the first few periods has been studied in order to determine how the sample surface affects the motion of the tube at smaller time scale. illustrates the a displacement and b velocity of the oscillating inner tube as a function of time for different locations of the semi infinite sample with respect to the edge of the outer tube for 10s.

The friction coefficient is chosen to be 10sfor and . For d 35 the surface is too far from the tube and the motion is determined mainly by F. The velocity has linearly increasing and decreasing portions corresponding to the appropriate segments of the vdW force between the tubes as shown in . As the surface is brought closer the duration of each period of zis shortened with the shortest time for one cycle corresponding to d 0 . The attractive part of Fcauses the tube to accelerate and non linear features of v are found when the tube is near the minimum of F. There the tube is accelerated for a short time and then it is quickly repelled by the repulsive part at a distance 2 from the sample surface. The velocity of the tube reverses its direction and the oscillating tube starts accelerating in the opposite direction. The motion process is repeated in reversed order.

The results obtained so far allow investigation of some characteristic times as a function of different parameters of the system. Focusing on the time of the first period of the oscillations T and the time of each period Tafter the inner tube has reached the regime of friction free oscillations after time t following the initial loss of energy due to the friction. In and the results for 1 Tand 1 Tare shown for tubes with two lengths for different values of the friction coefficient. The initial extrusion for the shorter tubes is 7.5 while for the longer ones is 30 .

It is interesting to see that the proximity of the surface has a rather profound effect on both 1 Tand 1 T. illustrates a the inverse of the time Tfor the tube to undergo the first complete cycle starting from rest for different and b inverse of the period Tof oscillations after the tube has reached the friction free regime as a function of the distance d.

Considering one sees that in the vicinity of d 11 shorter tubes and d 34 longer tubes there is a decrease in 1 T. This is explained with the location of the tube surface vdW potential minimum being very close to the stopping position of the moving tube. There the nanotube is attracted by the sample and it is slowed down as a result. Thus the tube spends extra time around that location before it is suddenly repelled by the repulsive vdW part resulting in a reversal of the motion. As the sample is brought closer to the edge of the stationary tube the influence of the repulsive part from the vdW potential becomes more significant and a rather large increase in 1 T and 1 Tis found. In fact the period for the first cycle of oscillations for the shorter and longer tubes can be changed by more than 2 times by bringing the surface at the very edge of the stationary tube d 0 .

Similar changes are found in showing 1 Tvs. d dependence. When the surface is in the close proximity of the surface d

Another feature that can be seen from is that the role of the friction on the characteristic 1 Ttime is relatively small. It is well know that friction does not affect very much the time for the first several periods of a mechanical underdamped oscillator while it can change significantly its amplitude and this is what is shown in and . For the friction free oscillations regime after the initial loss of energy the tube is not affected by any more. If is small the tube has not lost much energy and it oscillates in a relatively large distance region determined also by the location of the vdW minimum . If is large the tube has lost more energy and it oscillates in a smaller distance region. The net effect is such that the oscillatory frequency is not affected by the friction.

As such in accordance with the CNT oscillator of the present invention a practical device for profiling of surfaces is proposed. The operation of such a device is determined mainly by two factors i some CNT characteristic times show dramatic changes as a function of the tube surface distance d and are not affected by friction and ii the main contribution from the sample to the oscillatory motion comes from a rather localized circular region 5R. The goal is to be able to measure the characteristic times and relate them to the tube surface distance.

Consider for example the 5 0 7 9 double wall CNT with 2L 2L 150 and a sample of specific material characterized with atomic density Hamaker constants A and B and a friction coefficient . The double wall CNT is brought in the vicinity of the sample and the oscillatory motion is initiated by extruding the inner tube from the outer tube by some initial distance s. Then one can measure 1 Tusing the laser and detector and relate it to a specific distance d using the model described above Similarly 1 Tcan be measured after the tube has reached the friction free regime of oscillation and can also be related to d in accordance with the present invention. Since the oscillatory motion is determined mainly by the localized sample region r 1 nm in this case the sample or the tube is moved along the xy plane parallel to another position r. One measures 1 Tand or 1 Tagain and relates them to d. Thus repeating this process many times allows one to map the shape of the studied surfaces.

Different double wall CNT with various lengths and chiralities can be used for such a device. Shorter tubes result in more dramatic changes in 1 T but they have lesser extrusion capabilities thus surfaces with lesser roughness can be studied. Longer tubes result in less dramatic changes in 1 T but they can be extruded more and surfaces with larger roughness can be studied. In addition for thicker tubes larger regions from the sample will determine the vdW interaction and the oscillatory motion. Thus for thinner tubes the step of surface mapping is smaller resulting in a better in plane resolution.

The double wall CNT oscillator can be viewed as an alternative to an AFM tip for investigating surfaces. The main difficulties come from accurately measuring the first period of the oscillations and reinitiating the oscillatory motion. However there can be some advantageous features. Since it operates in a non contact mode it can be a virtually a non fatigued non wear system. Also the interaction between the oscillating nanotube and a rather localized region from the surface 1 nm for the 5 0 7 9 CNT makes it equivalent to a very sharp AFM tip a typical AFM tip has a 10 20 nm size therefore it is possible to obtain a higher in plane resolution as compared to the best AFM ones. Furthermore the steep 1 T vs. distance dependence slope leads to the possibility of achieving a high perpendicular to the surface resolution as well and consequently to profile surfaces with relatively small roughness less than 9 in a particular embodiment with the 2L 70 system . Finally the double CNT oscillator can be used even if the nanotubes do not have a perfect structure. This is suggested by experimental studies showing that sliding nanotubes have the ability to absorb induced damages and defects by self healing mechanisms and maintaining low dissipation processes.
