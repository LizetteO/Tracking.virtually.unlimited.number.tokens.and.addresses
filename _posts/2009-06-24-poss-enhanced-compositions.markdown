The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

This invention relates to methods for improving the properties of monomers and polymers by the addition of nano materials particularly POSS nano materials and the resulting compositions.

The controlled assembly of nanoscopic reinforcing particles in host polymer systems has resulted in improvements in various properties such as thermo oxidative stability response to mechanical load thermal expansion space survivability abrasion resistance and other surface related properties. The application of nanotechnology has enabled expansion of the end use envelope of many organic materials. Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes POSS has proven to be a remarkably effective class of additive nanoparticles due to their inherent size shape rigidity and versatility in functionality. The ability to chemically tailor POSS through synthetic control of its organic periphery offers a unique design tool for controlling particle dispersion in host materials.

However current commercially available POSS compounds such as POSS dianilines either contain thermally labile aliphatic groups or excessive amine functionality. For example octa aminophenyl POSS is the only purely aromatic version but contains eight reactive groups which can be detrimental to polymer performance due to excessive cross linking thereby inhibiting assembly.

Accordingly there is need and market for a suitable POSS composition which can overcome the above prior art shortcomings.

There has now been developed a new form of POSS dianilines which can be reactively incorporated into polyimides polyamides cyanate esters and epoxies for enhanced performance thereof as described below.

Broadly the present invention provides a method comprising the synthesis and application of novel high temperature POSS dianiline monomers namely heptaphenylbis aminophenyl methylsiloxy POSS which can be reactively incorporated into polyimides and epoxies for enhanced performance.

By nanoparticles as used herein is meant those of a size of 1 micron or less i.e. 1000 nanometers down to 1 nanometer. For example a POSS cage is considered to be about 1.5 nanometers wide.

By POSS dianiline monomer s as used herein is meant such monomers having para or meta amino substituents.

Referring to the present invention in detail the inventive POSS dianiline monomers are made by following synthesis 

The invention also provides MONOMER A same as above but having para NHs and method therefor similar to the above method

The invention also provides a method for incorporating POSS dianiline monomer having para or meta amino substituents into polymeric Kapton comprising 

In like manner the invention further provides a method for reactively incorporating POSS dianiline monomer into polyimides polyamides cyanate esters and epoxies to enhance the properties of same.

The invention thus describes the synthesis and subsequent application of novel polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane dianilines namely heptaphenylbis aminophenyl methylsiloxy POSS through a relatively cost effective manufacturing method where the amine groups can be placed in the meta or para positions. The uniqueness of the disclosed material in comparison with existing versions of POSS is its design for incorporation into those polymers designated as high temperature that can withstand continuous service at 200 350 degrees C. in an oxygen rich environment. From the viewpoint of chemical architecture heptaphenylbis aminophenyl methylsiloxy POSS features a T8 silsesquioxane cage surrounded by seven aromatic groups and a dianiline moeity that equips the molecule for facile attachment to host systems that accept amines through chemical reaction such as polyimides through linear copolymerization and epoxies where the dianiline can act as a crosslinking agent. High aromaticity and a lack of thermally labile groups enables unprecedented thermal stability for a POSS dianiline and good solubility in high temperature polymers.

The following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention and should not be construed in limitation thereof.

In a typical preparation the synthesis of the monomer precursor involves formation of di N N bis trimethylsilyl aminophenylchloromethylsilane using 3 Bis trimethylsilyl amino phenylmagnesium chloride and stoichiometric amount of trichloromethylsilane.

1M solution of 3 Bis trimethylsilyl amino phenylmagnesium chloride 30 mL 0.0300 mol in 25 mL of anhydrous THF was taken in an addition funnel and slowly added to a stirring mixture of trichioroinethylsilane in 15 mL anhydrous THF 2.252 gm 0.015 mol and stirred overnight. The solvent was pumped off from the reaction mixture and dry hexane added to extract the product by filteration. The light yellow colored filtrate was transferred to a distillation flask and all volatiles were removed under a dynamic vacuum. The residual viscous liquid was distilled using a Kugelrohr apparatus to give di N N bis trimethylsilyl aminophenylchloromethylsilane amino groups at meta position as a colorless viscous liquid in 90 yield.

Synthesis of Phenyl POSS silanol A solution of distilled silicon tetrachloride 1.915 g 0.0113 mol in anhydrous THF was added slowly to a stirring solution of 10 g 0.0107 mol of commercially available Phenyl triol in 50 mL anhydrous THF. This was followed by addition of 3.585 g 0.0354 mol in 5 mL anhydrous THF over a period of h. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight followed by filtration. The filter cake was washed with distilled HO THF and finally with chloroform. The organic layer was separated and stirred with 20 mL distilled water and 2 ml 0.1M dilute hydrochloric acid for 1 h. The organic layer was washed with HO dilute HCl and brine solution followed by rotavaping to slurry and crashed in 150 mL tech. methanol. After two hours of stirring the mixture was filtered and the filter cake dried to give 9.19 g 92 of pure Phenyl POSS silanol. Si NMR CDCl d 77.93 78.21 78.27 100.386

Incorporation into POSS Cages A solution of 0.67 g 1.216 mmol of di N N bis trimethylsilyl aminophenylchloromethylsilane in 2 mL dry ether was added very slowly to a stirring solution of 1.08 g 1.1 mmol POSS silanol in 5 mL dry ether and 2 mL anhydrous THF. To this was very slowly added a solution of 0.116 g 1.15 mmol of distilled triethylamine in dry ether. This was left stirring over night. The solution was filtered to remove NEt.HCl precipitates and rotavaped to slurry. The slurry was crashed in 150 mL reagent brand methanol acidified with glacial acetic acid to give POSS dianiline monomer in 98 yield. Si NMR CDC13 d 8.185 77.95 77.77 109.251 

Procedure for Incorporation into Kapton a polyimide noted below Heptaphenylbis aminophenyl methylsiloxy POSS is subsequently referred to as POSS diamine monomer.

Pyromellitic dianhydride PMDA was obtained from Aldrich and recrystallized in dioxane before use. Oxydianiline ODA was obtained from Lancaster synthesis and recrystallized in DMF Toluene before use. 99.9 Dimethyl acetamide was obtained from Aldrich and distilled under reduced pressure over Bad barium oxide before use.

Various proportions of POSS diamine monomer and 4 4 oxydianilne ODA were reacted with pyromellitic dianhydride PMDA to form PMDA ODA POSS diamine copoly amic acid 

The copoly amic acid of 5 wt. POSS PMDA ODA 1.9 cage was prepared by first putting 0.083 mmol 0.1 g of POSS diamine in 4 mL DMAC into a stirring solution of 4.50 mmol 0.901 g of ODA in 4 mL DMAC in inert atmosphere. Then after POSS diamine and ODA had dissolved completely 4.585 mmol 1 g of PMDA in 4 mL DMAC was slowly added to the stirring mixture of POSS diamine and ODA. The solution was stirred continuously overnight and a viscous PAA solution was obtained. 10 wt. 3.8 cage 15 wt. 5.7 cage and 20 wt. 7.7 cage copoly amic acid were obtained similarly by changing the various loadings.

PMDA ODA POSS diamine mixtures were cast on glass slides and subsequently put in vacuum oven at 80 C. for 4 hours and under a nitrogen purge. Imidization of POSS PMDA ODA was carried out by putting the samples in a nitrogen circulated vacuum oven at 120 160 200 250 for 1 h each and then at 280 C. for 2 h to ensure complete imidization.

In like manner the POSS dianiline can be reactively incorporated into other polyimides polyamides cyanate esters and epoxies for enhanced performance as noted above.

Heptaphenylbis aminophenyl methylsiloxy POSS features high aromaticity and unprecedented thermal stability for a POSS dianiline. The chemical architecture of the disclosed material enables POSS cage assembly during incorporation into a host polymer for optimal performance boosts and the high peripheral aromaticity of the POSS cage enables for an inter locking effect between cages if aggregation occurs. This in turn reduces local polymer chain motion around regions of high POSS concentration under conditions characterized by mechanical load and or thermal stress.

The POSS dianiline monomer of the invention can serve as a reinforcing agent for high performance thermoplastic or thermosetting polyimides polyamides cyanate esters and epoxies which can be used as structural materials or coatings for spacecraft aircraft rocket motors and engines ships and weapons as well as automotive structures and all domestic applications requiring materials with dimensional stability especially in situations with applied loads at elevated temperatures.

The POSS dianiline monomer of the invention can be used in applications for enhanced performance of polyimides polyamides cyanate esters or epoxies particularly where there are applied loads at elevated temperatures. Incorporation of such monomers into these polymers can improve the space surviveability thermo oxidative stability moisture resistance mechanical properties and surface characteristics of such polymers e.g. as used in structural and coating applications. Copolymerized materials derived from the present invention can be used on aircraft spacecraft ships automobiles and weapons.
