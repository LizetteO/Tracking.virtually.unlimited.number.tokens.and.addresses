abstract: What is provided are a system, method, and computer program product for protecting information displayed on a fax confirmation page. Several embodiments are provided. In one embodiment, for example, a Gaussian kernel is used to blur the digitized image to be printed on the confirmation page. In one method, a large enough blur kernel is selected so that text of a certain size will be rendered illegible. A method is also provided wherein a copy of the first page of the faxed document used to provide the content to be displayed on the confirmation page of the faxed document is stored on a storage device. A character sequence which references the stored original content on the storage media is printed on the confirmation page. A new confirmation page can be reconstructed and printed if it is desirable to have the altered content made visibly legible. Various other embodiments are disclosed.
