This invention was made with government support by the NIFA Small Business Innovation Research program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture grant numbers 2005 33610 15483 and 2006 33610 17595. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Our invention relates to harvesters particularly balers and provides a top infeed hopper system engineered to receive and direct cellulosic and particularly woody biomass materials into a baling chamber.

In 1978 forestry researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute VPI conducted field tests using a hay baler powered by the hydraulics of a knuckle boom loader and concluded that baling offers considerable cost and operational advantages as a method of recovering forest residues for either fiber or fuel 1 see the appended Citations .

The VPI researchers then built and tested a prototype in woods logging residue baler 2 7 . Following testing of the VPI prototype baler in the North Western U.S.A. in the early 1980 s several design modifications were suggested for a second generation baler 8 9 including the need for a top infeed to allow processing of small size material See 8 at pp. 29 30 .

Various biomass bundlers and balers have been proposed in the patent literature 10 . Presently the only commercial systems are a bundler the John Deere 1490D Energy Wood Harvester 11 and a round baler the SuperTrak WB55 Biobaler 12 .

Particularly relevant to the present invention are the open top finger baler disclosures of Risoda Pty. Limited 13 .

The present inventors have reported their progress under a federal contract from the USDA CSREES SBIR program to develop better methods to collect and transport woody biomass 14 20 . Our goal has been to engineer more efficient recovery and transport of woody biomass to second generation bioenergy and biofuel plants.

Here we describe an infeed hopper system suitable for receiving and directing cellulosic biomass materials into a baling chamber situated below the hopper. Our invention provides a baler for making compacted bales of a cellulosic and preferably woody biomass material the baler comprising a housing defining a compaction chamber therein wherein the housing comprises a top wall an infeed opening defined in the top wall for introducing the material into the compaction chamber and a hopper system comprising first and second doors pivotably attached to the housing in opposing array over the infeed opening wherein each door comprises a pivot having a plurality of fingers extending in planar array therefrom and defining a plurality of recesses disposed therebetween and wherein the fingers of the first and second doors are staggered such that the fingers of each door are positioned opposite to and receivable by the recesses of the other door and actuator means for pivoting the doors upwardly to form a chute for directing the material toward the infeed opening and downwardly to intermesh and preferably interlock the fingers and substantially cover the infeed opening.

We have applied engineering design principles to the long felt need of providing a top infeed system for cellulosic and particularly woody biomass balers.

The term cellulosic biomass as used herein refers generally to encompass all plant materials harvested by baling for use as industrial feedstocks including woody biomass energy crops like switchgrass miscanthus and hemp and agricultural crop residues including corn stover.

The term woody biomass as used herein refers to all parts of trees shrubs and woody plants useable as industrial feedstocks for fiber bioenergy and biofuels including timber harvest residues and land clearing debris small diameter trees shrubs and brush dedicated energy crops like willow and poplar tree service prunings and residential green waste.

The following Table lists the reference numerals used in the description of the currently preferred embodiment that is shown in the FIGURES.

Nomenclature with respect to the baler shown in the FIGURES toward the platen assembly is referred to herein for illustrative purposes as front and toward the compaction chamber assembly as rear .

The platen assembly has a welded steel framework that anchors and supports two telescoping hydraulic cylinders three stage 6 5 and 4 inches that attach to and move a compression platen reciprocally through the baling chamber .

When fully retracted as shown in this view the compression platen forms the front wall of the infeed chamber assembly . The infeed chamber assembly has an upper framework that demarcates a large rectangular infeed opening . A pair of closeable hopper doors is mounted in opposing array over the infeed opening . Each of the doors is pivotally connected to the framework by a hinge pin . When raised as shown here the hopper doors create an open chute through which a grapple loader not shown can drop and push biomass materials through the infeed opening into the baling chamber . When closed see the hopper doors intermesh and preferably interlock together in horizontal planar array so as to substantially close the infeed opening and thereby form an upper wall of the infeed chamber assembly without obstructing transit of the compression platen .

The infeed chamber assembly also has two side walls and a floor plate that together with the retracted compression platen and the upper framework with closed hopper doors define the front end or infeed compartment of the baling chamber . Construction and operation of the hopper doors is discussed in detail below. Shown here is a single 2 hydraulic cylinder that moves the front hopper door and two 2 hydraulic cylinders that move the rear hopper door .

The compaction chamber assembly houses the rear end or compression compartment of the baling chamber . The compaction chamber assembly has fixed upper and lower walls . The rear wall or end cap is configured as a contingency door shown open that is mounted on lateral hinges . The contingency door is bolted shut during the baling process but can be manually opened if need be to remove defective bales from the baling chamber and for this purpose the compression hydraulic cylinders are configured to push the compression platen at least the entire length of the compaction chamber assembly .

An ejection platen and a discharge door form the sidewalls of the compaction chamber assembly . When bale formation is completed the discharge door is cantilevered downward into a horizontal platform as shown in this view . Two pairs of telescopic hydraulic cylinders two stage 4 and 3 inches then move the ejection platen to push the bale across the compaction chamber assembly and onto the opened discharge door .

The hopper doors are then pivoted concurrently into full horizontal closure . These closing movements are coordinated so that the rear hopper door reaches horizontal first thereby presenting its notched latch fingers for engagement by the door latches on the first hopper door .

As the overlapping hopper doors press the overflowing biomass material downward through the infeed opening there is an opportunity for some of the material to become entrapped between the fingers and within the closing recesses . We have found that configuring the hopper doors so that about a one inch gap of recess space remains between the fully intermeshed fingers is suitable for woody biomass materials like arborist tree trimmings. Any such materials that become entrapped between the framework and the outer latch bars or the rear pivot tend to be pulled into the baling chamber as the compression platen advances and any materials entrapped between the front pivot and the frame are pushed and broken off against the rear shear bars . For forestry applications the latch fingers can additionally be provided with edged shear bars knives or slashing saws not shown as can any of the fingers .

Following bill of materials is for the hopper door assembly shown in the FIGURES sized for an infeed opening measuring 48 wide 30 long.

While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
