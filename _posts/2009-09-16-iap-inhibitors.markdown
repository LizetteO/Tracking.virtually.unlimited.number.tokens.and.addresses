The present invention describes compounds that are inhibitors of IAPs inhibitors of apoptosis proteins processes for their preparation pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy. The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of cancer autoimmune diseases and other disorders.

Apoptosis programmed cell death plays a central role in the development and homeostasis of all multi cellular organisms. Apoptosis can be initiated within a cell from an external factor such as a chemokine an extrinsic pathway or via an intracellular event such a DNA damage an intrinsic pathway . Alterations in apoptotic pathways have been implicated in many types of human pathologies including developmental disorders cancer autoimmune diseases as well as neurodegenerative disorders. One mode of action of chemotherapeutic drugs is cell death via apoptosis.

Apoptosis is conserved across species and executed primarily by activated caspases a family of cysteine proteases with aspartate specificity in their substrates. These cysteine containing aspartate specific proteases caspases are produced in cells as catalytically inactive zymogens and are proteolytically processed to become active proteases during apoptosis. Once activated effector caspases are responsible for proteolytic cleavage of a broad spectrum of cellular targets that ultimately lead to cell death. In normal surviving cells that have not received an apoptotic stimulus most caspases remain inactive. If caspases are aberrantly activated their proteolytic activity can be inhibited by a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins called IAPs inhibitors of apoptosis proteins .

The IAP family of proteins suppresses apoptosis by preventing the activation of procaspases and inhibiting the enzymatic activity of mature caspases. Several distinct mammalian IAPs including XIAP c IAP1 c IAP2 ML IAP NAIP neuronal apoptosis inhibiting protein Bruce and survivin have been identified and they all exhibit anti apoptotic activity in cell culture. IAPs were originally discovered in baculovirus by their functional ability to substitute for P35 protein an anti apoptotic gene. IAPs have been described in organisms ranging from Drosophila to human and are known to be overexpressed in many human cancers. Generally speaking IAPs comprise one to three Baculovirus IAP repeat BIR domains and most of them also possess a carboxyl terminal RING finger motif. The BIR domain itself is a zinc binding domain of about 70 residues comprising 4 alpha helices and 3 beta strands with cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate the zinc ion. It is the BIR domain that is believed to cause the anti apoptotic effect by inhibiting the caspases and thus inhibiting apoptosis. XIAP is expressed ubiquitously in most adult and fetal tissues. Overexpression of XIAP in tumor cells has been demonstrated to confer protection against a variety of pro apoptotic stimuli and promotes resistance to chemotherapy. Consistent with this a strong correlation between XIAP protein levels and survival has been demonstrated for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Down regulation of XIAP expression by antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to sensitize tumor cells to death induced by a wide range of pro apoptotic agents both in vitro and in vivo

In normal cells signaled to undergo apoptosis however the IAP mediated inhibitory effect must be removed a process at least in part performed by a mitochondrial protein named Smac second mitochondrial activator of caspases . Smac or DIABLO is synthesized as a precursor molecule of 239 amino acids the N terminal 55 residues serve as the mitochondria targeting sequence that is removed after import. The mature form of Smac contains 184 amino acids and behaves as an oligomer in solution. Smac and various fragments thereof have been proposed for use as targets for identification of therapeutic agents.

Smac is synthesized in the cytoplasm with an N terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that is proteolytically removed during maturation to the mature polypeptide and is then targeted to the inter membrane space of mitochondria. At the time of apoptosis induction Smac is released from mitochondria into the cytosol together with cytochrome c where it binds to IAPs and enables caspase activation therein eliminating the inhibitory effect of IAPs on apoptosis. Whereas cytochrome c induces multimerization of Apaf 1 to activate procaspase 9 and 3 Smac eliminates the inhibitory effect of multiple IAPs. Smac interacts with essentially all IAPs that have been examined to date including XIAP c IAP1 c IAP2 ML IAP and survivin. Thus Smac appears to be a master regulator of apoptosis in mammals.

It has been shown that Smac promotes not only the proteolytic activation of procaspases but also the enzymatic activity of mature caspase both of which depend upon its ability to interact physically with IAPs. X ray crystallography has shown that the first four amino acids AVPI of mature Smac bind to a portion of IAPs. This N terminal sequence is essential for binding IAPs and blocking their anti apoptotic effects.

Currently there are drug discovery efforts aimed at identifying compounds that interfere with the role played by IAPs in disease states where a defect in apoptosis is implicated such as in cancers and autoimmune diseases. Indeed a number of IAP inhibitors that mimic the interactions of the Smac tetrapeptide are now known and possess pro apoptotic activity in vitro and in vivo. Some IAP inhibitors demonstrate potent single agent anti tumor activity in vitro and in vivo but unfortunately present an elevated risk of unwanted effects when administered in vivo e.g. reduced cardiac output and elevated intestinal epithelial apoptosis . Thus the art continues to look for additional compounds that may function as IAP inhibitors.

The present invention provides IAP inhibitors and therapeutic methods of using these inhibitors to modulate apoptosis.

For simplicity and illustrative purposes the principles of the invention are described by referring mainly to specific illustrative embodiments thereof. In addition in the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent however to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances well known methods and structures have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the invention.

 Alkyl monovalent and alkylene divalent when alone or as part of another term e.g. alkoxy mean branched or unbranched saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group having up to 12 carbon atoms unless otherwise specified. Examples of particular alkyl groups include but are not limited to methyl ethyl n propyl isopropyl n butyl iso butyl sec butyl tert butyl n pentyl 2 methylbutyl 2 2 dimethylpropyl n hexyl 2 methylpentyl 2 2 dimethylbutyl n heptyl 3 heptyl 2 methylhexyl and the like. The term lower when used to modify alkyl alkenyl etc. means 1 to 4 carbon atoms branched or linear so that e.g. the terms lower alkyl C Calkyl and alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms are synonymous and used interchangeably to mean methyl ethyl 1 propyl isopropyl cyclopropyl 1 butyl sec butyl or t butyl. Examples of alkylene groups include but are not limited to methylene ethylene n propylene n butylene and 2 methyl butylene.

The term substituted alkyl refers to alkyl moieties having substituents replacing one or more hydrogens on one or more often no more than four carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon backbone. Such substituents are independently selected from the group consisting of a halogen e.g. I Br Cl or F hydroxy amino cyano mercapto alkoxy such as a C Calkoxy e.g. methoxy or ethoxy to yield an alkoxyalkyl aryloxy such as phenoxy to yield an aryloxyalkyl nitro oxo e.g. carbonyl carboxyl which is the combination of an oxo and hydroxy substituent on a single carbon atom carbamoyl an aminocarbonyl such as NHC O cycloalkyl e.g. a cycloalkylalkyl aryl resulting for example in aralkyls such as benzyl or phenylethyl heterocyclylalkyl e.g. heterocycloalkylalkyl heteroaryl e.g. heteroarylalkyl alkylsulfonyl including lower alkylsulfonyl such as methylsulfonyl arylsulfonyl such as phenylsulfonyl and OCF which is a halogen substituted alkoxy . The invention further contemplates that several of these alkyl substituents including specifically alkoxy cycloalkyl aryl heterocyclyalkyl and heteroaryl are optionally further substituted as defined in connection with each of their respective definitions provided below. In addition certain alkyl substituent moieties result from a combination of such substitutions on a single carbon atom. For example an ester moiety e.g. an alkoxycarbonyl such as tert butoxycarbonyl or Boc is a substituted alkyl that results from the substitution on a methyl group CH of both an oxo O and an unsubstituted alkoxy e.g. a tert butoxy CH C O replacing the three hydrogens. Similarly an amide moiety e.g. an alkylaminocarbonyl such as dimethlyaminocarbonyl is a substituted alkyl that results from the substitution on a methyl group CH of both an oxo O and a di unsubstitutedalkylamino e.g. dimethylamino N CH replacing the three hydrogens. Exemplary substituted alkyl groups include cyanomethyl nitromethyl hydroxyalkyls such as hydroxymethyl trityloxymethyl propionyloxymethyl aminoalkyls such as aminomethyl carboxylalkyls such as carboxymethyl carboxyethyl carboxypropyl 2 3 dichloropentyl 3 hydroxy 5 carboxyhexyl acetyl e.g. an alkanoyl where in the case of acetyl the two hydrogen atoms on the CHportion of an ethyl group are replaced by an oxo O 2 aminopropyl pentachlorobutyl trifluoromethyl methoxyethyl 3 hydroxypentyl 4 chlorobutyl 1 2 dimethyl propyl pentafluoroethyl alkyloxycarbonylmethyl allyloxycarbonylaminomethyl carbamoyloxymethyl methoxymethyl ethoxymethyl t butoxymethyl acetoxymethyl chloromethyl bromomethyl iodomethyl trifluoromethyl 6 hydroxyhexyl 2 4 dichloro n butyl 2 amino iso propyl and 2 carbamoyloxyethyl. Particular substituted alkyls are substituted methyl groups. Examples of substituted methyl group include groups such as hydroxymethyl protected hydroxymethyl e.g. tetrahydropyranyl oxymethyl acetoxymethyl carbamoyloxymethyl trifluoromethyl chloromethyl carboxymethyl carboxyl where the three hydrogen atoms on the methyl are replaced two of the hydrogens are replaced by an oxo O and the other hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxy OH tert butoxycarbonyl where the three hydrogen atoms on the methyl are replaced two of the hydrogens are replaced by an oxo O and the other hydrogen is replaced by a tert butoxy O C CH bromomethyl and iodomethyl.

The term substituted alkylene refers to alkylene moieties having substituents replacing one or more hydrogens on one or more often no more than four carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon backbone where the alkylene is similarly substituted with groups as set forth above for alkyl.

Alkoxy is O alkyl. A substituted alkoxy is O substituted alkyl where the alkoxy is similarly substituted with groups as set forth above for alkyl. One substituted alkoxy is acetoxy where two of the hydrogens in ethoxy e.g. O CH CH are replaced by an oxo O to yield O C O CHanother is an aralkoxy where one of the hydrogens in the alkoxy is replaced by an aryl such as benzyloxy.

Using the procedures outlined in the schemes presented above and where necessary the appropriate amino acid reagents one can prepare the compounds presented in TABLES 1 2 and 3. The results of testing compounds for their binding affinities K to XIAP BIR 3 and cIAP 1 BIR 3 and for their ability to inhibit the growth CC of an ovarian cancer cell line SK OV 3 are reported as ranges in TABLES 1 2 and 3.

It is intended that the present invention encompass compounds that are synthesized in vitro using laboratory techniques such as those well known to synthetic chemists or synthesized using in vivo techniques such as through metabolism fermentation digestion and the like. It is also contemplated that the compounds of the present invention may be synthesized using a combination of in vitro and in vivo techniques.

The present invention also includes isotopically labelled compounds which are identical to those recited herein but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorous fluorine and chlorine such as H H C C N O O P P S F and Cl.

Compounds of the present invention that contain the aforementioned isotopes and or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labelled compounds of the present invention for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated are useful in drug and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detection. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of this invention can generally be prepared by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non isotopically labelled reagent.

The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms including hydrated forms. The compounds of the present invention e.g. compounds of Formula I IS IR II IIS IIR III IIIS and IIIR also are capable of forming both pharmaceutically acceptable salts including but not limited to acid addition and or base addition salts. Furthermore compounds of the present invention may exist in various solid states including an amorphous form noncrystalline form and in the form of clathrates prodrugs polymorphs bio hydrolyzable esters racemic mixtures non racemic mixtures or as purified stereoisomers including but not limited to optically pure enantiomers and diastereomers. In general all of these forms can be used as an alternative form to the free base or free acid forms of the compounds as described above and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.

A polymorph refers to solid crystalline forms of a compound. Different polymorphs of the same compound can exhibit different physical chemical and or spectroscopic properties. Different physical properties include but are not limited to stability e.g. to heat or light compressibility and density important in formulation and product manufacturing and dissolution rates which can affect bioavailability . Different physical properties of polymorphs can affect their processing.

A clathrate means a compound or a salt thereof in the form of a crystal lattice that contains spaces e.g. channels that have a guest molecule e.g. a solvent or water trapped within.

As noted above the compounds of the present invention can be administered inter alia as pharmaceutically acceptable salts esters amides or prodrugs. The term salts refers to inorganic and organic salts of compounds of the present invention. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of a compound or by separately reacting a purified compound in its free base or acid form with a suitable organic or inorganic base or acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative salts include the hydrobromide hydrochloride sulfate bisulfate nitrate acetate oxalate palmitiate stearate laurate borate benzoate lactate phosphate tosylate citrate maleate fumarate succinate tartrate naphthylate mesylate glucoheptonate lactobionate and laurylsulphonate salts and the like.

Acceptable esters also include C Ccycloalkyl esters as well as arylalkyl esters such as benzyl. C Calkyl esters are commonly used. Esters of compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to methods that are well known in the art.

Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable amides of the compounds of the present invention include amides derived from ammonia primary C Calkyl amines and secondary C Cdialkyl amines. In the case of secondary amines the amine may also be in the form of a 5 or 6 membered heterocycloalkyl group containing at least one nitrogen atom. Amides derived from ammonia C Cprimary alkyl amines and C Cdialkyl secondary amines are commonly used. Amides of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to methods well known to those skilled in the art.

The term prodrug refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formulae for example by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella Pro drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design ed. Edward B. Roche American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press 1987 both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

To illustrate if the compound of the invention contains a carboxylic acid functional group a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as C Calkyl C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms 1 methyl 1 alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms 1 alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms 1 methyl 1 alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms N alkoxycarbonyl aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms 1 N alkoxycarbonyl aminomethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms 3 phthalidyl 4 crotonolactonyl gamma butyrolacton 4 yl di N N C C alkylamino C C alkyl such as dimethylaminoethyl carbamoyl C C alkyl N N di C C alkylcarbamoyl C C alkyl and piperidino pyrrolidino or morpholino C C alkyl.

Similarly if a compound of the present invention comprises an alcohol functional group a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl 1 methyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl C C alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl N C C alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl succinoyl C C alkanoyl amino C C alkanoyl arylacyl and aminoacyl or aminoacyl aminoacyl where each aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L amino acids P O OH P O O C C alkyl or glycosyl the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate .

Compounds and salts of the present invention may also exist in tautomeric forms such as an enol and an imine form and the corresponding keto and enamine forms and geometric isomers and mixtures thereof. Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in solution. In solid form usually one tautomer predominates. Even though only one tautomer may be described by the formulae above the present invention includes all tautomers of the present compounds.

The compounds of the present invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is contemplated that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds as well as mixtures thereof including racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. In addition the present invention contemplates all geometric and positional isomers. For example if the compound contains a double bond both the cis and trans forms designated as Z and E respectively as well as mixtures are contemplated.

Mixture of stereoisomers such as diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual stereochemical components on the basis of their physical chemical differences by known methods such as chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can also be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diasteromeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound e.g. an alcohol separating the diastereomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also some compounds may be atropisomers e.g. substituted biaryls .

The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water ethanol and the like. The present invention contemplates and encompasses both the solvated and unsolvated forms.

The compounds of the present invention can be administered to a patient either alone or a part of a pharmaceutical composition in a therapeutically effective amount. A variety of non limiting methods for administering the compounds and related compositions to patients include orally rectally parenterally intravenously intramuscularly or subcutaneously intracisternally intravaginally intraperitoneally intravesically locally powders ointments or drops or as a buccal or nasal spray. In addition the substance or compositions containing the active substances can be administered all at once as for example by a bolus injection multiple times such as by a series of tablets or delivered substantially uniformly over a period of time as for example using transdermal delivery. It is also noted that the dose of the substances can be varied over time.

The compounds and related compositions of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically active substances. The other pharmaceutically active substances can be intended to treat the same disease or condition as the substances of the present invention or a different disease or condition. If the patient is to receive or is receiving multiple pharmaceutically active substances the substances can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. For example in the case of tablets the active substances may be found in one tablet or in separate tablets which can be administered at once or sequentially in any order. In addition it should be recognized that the compositions may be different forms. For example one or more substance may be delivered via a tablet while another is administered via injection or orally as a syrup. All combinations delivery methods and administration sequences are contemplated.

Pharmaceutical compositions to be used comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound as described above or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or other form thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The phrase pharmaceutical composition refers to a composition suitable for administration in medical or veterinary use. It should be appreciated that the determinations of proper dosage forms dosage amounts and routes of administration for a particular patient are within the level of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical and medical arts.

Compositions suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of a compound or composition of the invention which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. This aqueous preparation may be formulated according to known methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents emulsifying and suspending agents. Various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol and sorbic acid also may be included. The sterile injectable preparation also may be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or di glycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid may be used in the preparation of injectables. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Carrier formulation suitable for subcutaneous intravenous intramuscular etc. administrations can be found in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto.

Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules tablets pills powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms the compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable excipient such as a fillers or extenders as for example starches lactose sucrose glucose mannitol and silicic acid b binders as for example carboxymethylcellulose alignates gelatin polyvinylpyrrolidone sucrose and acacia c humectants as for example glycerol d disintegrating agents as for example agar agar calcium carbonate potato or tapioca starch alginic acid certain complex silicates and sodium carbonate e solution retarders as for example paraffin f absorption accelerators as for example quaternary ammonium compounds g wetting agents as for example cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate h adsorbents as for example kaolin and bentonite and i lubricants as for example talc calcium stearate magnesium stearate solid polyethylene glycols sodium lauryl sulfate or mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules tablets and pills the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Solid dosage forms such as tablets dragees capsules pills and granules also can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and others well known in the art. The solid dosage form also may contain opacifying agents and can also be of such composition that they release the active compound or compounds in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used are polymeric substances and waxes. The active compounds can also be in micro encapsulated form if appropriate with one or more of the above mentioned excipients. Such solid dosage forms may generally contain from 1 to 95 w w of the active compound. In certain embodiments the active compound ranges from 5 to 70 w w .

Since one aspect of the present invention contemplates the treatment of the disease conditions with a combination of pharmaceutically active agents that may be administered separately the invention further relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. The kit comprises two separate pharmaceutical compositions a substance of the present invention and a second pharmaceutical substance. The kit comprises a container for containing the separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. Additional examples of containers include syringes boxes and bags. Typically the kit comprises directions for the use of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms e.g. oral and parenteral are administered at different dosage intervals or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician or veterinarian.

An example of such a kit is a so called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms tablets capsules and the like . Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.

It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the kit e.g. in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card e.g. as follows First Week Monday Tuesday . . . etc. . . . Second Week Monday Tuesday . . . etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A daily dose can be a single tablet or capsule or several pills or capsules to be taken on a given day. Also a daily dose of a substance of the present invention can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of the second substance can consist of several tablets or capsules and vice versa. The memory aid should reflect this and aid in correct administration of the active agents.

In another specific embodiment of the invention a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use is provided. Preferably the dispenser is equipped with a memory aid so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory aid is a mechanical counter which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory aid is a battery powered micro chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout or audible reminder signal which for example reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken.

Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions solutions suspensions syrups and elixirs. In addition to the compound or composition the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as water or other solvents solubilizing agents and emulsifiers as for example ethyl alcohol isopropyl alcohol ethyl carbonate ethyl acetate benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate propyleneglycol 1 3 butyleneglycol dimethylformamide oils in particular cottonseed oil groundnut oil corn germ oil olive oil castor oil and sesame oil glycerol tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethyleneglycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan or mixtures of these substances. Besides such inert diluents the composition can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents emulsifying and suspending agents sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents.

Compositions for rectal administrations are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing compounds of the present invention with suitable non irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter polyethyleneglycol or a low melting suppository wax which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.

Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include ointments powders sprays and inhalants. The active compound is admixed under sterile conditions with a physiologically acceptable carrier and any preservatives buffers or propellants as may be required. Ophthalmic formulations eye ointments powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.

The compounds and compositions of the present invention also may benefit from a variety of delivery systems including time released delayed release or sustained release delivery systems. Such option may be particularly beneficial when the compounds and composition are used in conjunction with other treatment protocals as described in more detail below.

Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer base systems such as poly lactide glycolide copolyoxalates polycaprolactones polyesteramides polyorthoesters polyhydroxybutyric acid and polyanhydrides. Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 075 109. Delivery systems also include non polymer systems that are lipids including sterols such as cholesterol cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as mono di and tri glycerides hydrogel release systems sylastic systems peptide based systems wax coatings compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients partially fused implants and the like. Specific examples include but are not limited to a erosional systems in which the active compound is contained in a form within a matrix such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 452 775 4 667 014 4 748 034 and 5 239 660 and b diffusional systems in which an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a polymer such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 832 253 and 3 854 480. In addition pump based hardware delivery systems can be used some of which are adapted for implantation.

Use of a long term sustained release implant may be desirable. Long term release as used herein means that the implant is constructed and arranged to deliver therapeutic levels of the active compound for at least 30 days and preferably 60 days. Long term sustained release implants are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include some of the release systems described above.

In practicing the methods of the present invention the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered in a therapeutically effective amount. Generally doses of active compounds would be from about 0.01 mg kg per day to 1000 mg kg per day. It is expected that doses ranging from 50 500 mg kg will be suitable preferably intravenously intramuscularly or intradermally and in one or several administrations per day. The compounds of the present invention may also be used in combination with radiation therapy hormone therapy surgery and immunotherapy which therapies are well know to those skilled in the art.

When practicing the conjoint or combination therapy described in more detail below the administration of the compounds and compositions of the present invention can occur simultaneous with subsequent to or prior to chemotherapy or radiation so long as the chemotherapeutic agent or radiation sensitizes the system to the compounds and compositions of the present invention.

In general routine experimentation in clinical trials will determine specific ranges for optimal therapeutic effect for a particular compound and composition of the present invention and each administrative protocol and administration to specific patients will be adjusted to within effective and safe ranges depending on the patient condition and responsiveness to initial administrations. However the ultimate administration protocol will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age condition and size of the patient the potency of the compound or composition the duration of the treatment and the severity of the disease being treated. For example a dosage regimen of the compound or composition can be an oral administration of from 1 mg to 2000 mg day preferably 1 to 1000 mg day more preferably 50 to 600 mg day in two to four preferably two divided doses to reduce tumor growth. Intermittent therapy e.g. one week out of three weeks or three out of four weeks may also be used.

In the event that a response in a subject is insufficient at the initial doses applied higher doses or effectively higher doses by a different more localized delivery route may be employed to the extent that the patient tolerance permits. Multiple doses per day are contemplated to achieve appropriate systemic levels of compounds. Generally a maximum dose is used that is the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand however that a patient may insist upon a lower dose or tolerable dose for medical reasons psychological reasons or for virtually any other reason.

The compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention can be administered to a subject suffering from cancer an autoimmune disease or another disorder where a defect in apoptosis is implicated. In connection with such treatments the patient can be treated prophylactically acutely or chronically using compounds and compositions of the present invention depending on the nature of the disease. Typically the host or subject in each of these methods is human although other mammals may also benefit from the administration of a compound of the present invention.

As described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 244 851 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference IAP antagonists can be used for the treatment of all cancer types which fail to undergo apoptosis. Thus compounds of the present invention can be used to provide a therapeutic approach to the treatment of many kinds of solid tumors including but not limited to carcinomas sarcomas including Kaposi s sarcoma erythroblastoma glioblastoma meningioma astrocytoma melanoma and myoblastoma. Treatment or prevention of non solid tumor cancers such as leukemia is also contemplated by this invention. Indications may include but are not limited to brain cancers skin cancers bladder cancers ovarian cancers breast cancers gastric cancers pancreatic cancers colon cancers blood cancers lung cancers and bone cancers. Examples of such cancer types include neuroblastoma intestine carcinoma such as rectum carcinoma colon carcinoma familiary adenomatous polyposis carcinoma and hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer esophageal carcinoma labial carcinoma larynx carcinoma hypopharynx carcinoma tong carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma gastric carcinoma adenocarcinoma medullary thyroidea carcinoma papillary thyroidea carcinoma renal carcinoma kidney parenchym carcinoma ovarian carcinoma cervix carcinoma uterine corpus carcinoma endometrium carcinoma chorion carcinoma pancreatic carcinoma prostate carcinoma testis carcinoma breast carcinoma urinary carcinoma melanoma brain tumors such as glioblastoma astrocytoma meningioma medulloblastoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors Hodgkin lymphoma non Hodgkin lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma acute lymphatic leukemia ALL chronic lymphatic leukemia CLL acute myeloid leukemia AML chronic myeloid leukemia CML adult T cell leukemia lymphoma hepatocellular carcinoma gall bladder carcinoma bronchial carcinoma small cell lung carcinoma non small cell lung carcinoma multiple myeloma basalioma teratoma retinoblastoma choroidea melanoma seminoma rhabdomyo sarcoma craniopharyngeoma osteosarcoma chondrosarcoma myosarcoma liposarcoma fibrosarcoma Ewing sarcoma and plasmocytoma.

The inventors believe that the IAP antagonists of the present invention will be particularly active for treating human malignancies where cIAP1 and cIAP2 are over expressed e.g. lung cancers see Dai et al Hu. Molec. Genetics 2003 v 12 pp 791 801 leukemias multiple references and other cancers Tamm et al Clin Cancer Res 2000 v 6 1796 1803 . The inventors also expect that the IAP antagonists of the present invention will be active in disorders that may be driven by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF playing a pro survival role for example there is a well defined role for TNF acting as a survival factor in ovarian carcinoma similarly for gastric cancers see Kulbe et al Cancer Res 2007 67 585 592 .

In addition to apoptosis defects found in tumors defects in the ability to eliminate self reactive cells of the immune system due to apoptosis resistance are considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are characterized in that the cells of the immune system produce antibodies against its own organs and molecules or directly attack tissues resulting in the destruction of the latter. A failure of those self reactive cells to undergo apoptosis leads to the manifestation of the disease. Defects in apoptosis regulation have been identified in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erthematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.

Examples of such autoimmune diseases include collagen diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus Sharp s syndrome CREST syndrome calcinosis Raynaud s syndrome esophageal dysmotility telangiectasia dermatomyositis vasculitis Morbus Wegener s and Sj gren s syndrome renal diseases such as Goodpasture s syndrome rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis and membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis type II endocrine diseases such as type I diabetes autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy APECED autoimmune parathyroidism pernicious anemia gonad insufficiency idiopathic Morbus Addison s hyperthyreosis Hashimoto s thyroiditis and primary myxedema skin diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris bullous pemphigoid herpes gestationis epidermolysis bullosa and erythema multiforme major liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis autoimmune cholangitis autoimmune hepatitis type 1 autoimmune hepatitis type 2 primary sclerosing cholangitis neuronal diseases such as multiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis myasthenic Lambert Eaton syndrome acquired neuromyotony Guillain Barr syndrome M ller Fischer syndrome stiff man syndrome cerebellar degeneration ataxia opsoklonus sensoric neuropathy and achalasia blood diseases such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura Morbus Werlhof infectious diseases with associated autoimmune reactions such as AIDS Malaria and Chagas disease.

The present invention also is directed to the use of the compounds and compositions as a chemopotentiating agent with other treatment approaches. The term chemopotentiating agent refers to an agent that acts to increase the sensitivity of an organism tissue or cell to a chemical compound or treatment namely chemotherapeutic agents or chemo drugs or to radiation treatment. Thus compounds and compositions of the present invention can be used for inhibiting tumor growth in vivo by administering them in combination with a biologic or chemotherapeutic agent or by using them in combination with chemoradiation. In these applications the administration of the compounds and compositions of the present invention may occur prior to and with sufficient time to cause sensitization of the site to be treated. Alternatively the compounds and compositions of the present invention may be used contemporaneously with radiation and or additional anti cancer chemical agents infra . Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compounds and compositions of the present invention increasing convenience to the subject and the physician and may be particularly suitable for certain compositions of the present invention.

Biological and chemotherapeutics anti neoplastic agents and radiation induce apoptosis by activating the extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathways and since the compounds and compositions of the present invention relieve antagonists of apoptotic proteins IAPs and thus remove the block in apoptosis the combination of chemotherapeutics anti neoplastic agents and radiation with the compounds and compositions of the present invention should work synergistically to facilitate apoptosis.

A combination of a compound of the present invention and a chemotherapeutic anti neoplastic agent and or radiation therapy of any type that activates the intrinsic pathway may provide a more effective approach to destroying tumor cells. Compounds of the present invention interact with IAP s such as XIAP cIAP 1 cIAP 2 ML IAP etc. and block the IAP mediated inhibition of apoptosis while chemotherapeutics anti neoplastic agents and or radiation therapy kills actively dividing cells by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway leading to apoptosis and cell death. As is described in more detail below embodiments of the invention provide combinations of a compound of the present invention and a chemotherapeutic anti neoplastic agent and or radiation which provide a synergistic action against unwanted cell proliferation. This synergistic action between a compound of the present invention and a chemotherapeutic anti neoplastic agent and or radiation therapy can improve the efficiency of the chemotherapeutic anti neoplastic agent and or radiation therapies. This will allow for an increase in the effectiveness of current chemotherapeutic anti neoplastic agents or radiation treatments allowing the dose of the chemotherapeutic anti neoplastic agent to be lowered therein providing both a more effective dosing schedule as well as use of a more tolerable dose of chemotherapeutic anti neoplastic agent and or radiation.

In an embodiment of the present invention the patient is treated by administering a compound or a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention at a time the patient is subject to concurrent or antecedent radiation or chemotherapy for treatment of a neoproliferative pathology of a tumor such as but not limited to bladder cancer breast cancer prostate cancer lung cancer pancreatic cancer gastric cancer colon cancer ovarian cancer renal cancer hepatoma melanoma lymphoma sarcoma and combinations thereof.

In another embodiment of the present invention the compound or composition of the present invention can be administered in combination with a chemotherapeutic and or for use in combination with radiotherapy immunotherapy and or photodynamic therapy promoting apoptosis and enhancing the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic radiotherapy immunotherapy and or photodynamic therapy.

Embodiments of the invention also include a method of treating a patient afflicted with cancer by the contemporaneous or concurrent administration of a chemotherapeutic agent. Such chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to the chemotherapeutic agents described in Modern Pharmacology with Clinical Applications Sixth Edition Craig Stitzel Chpt. 56 pg 639 656 2004 herein incorporated by reference. The chemotherapeutic agent can be but is not limited to alkylating agents antimetabolites anti tumor antibiotics plant derived products such as taxanes enzymes hormonal agents miscellaneous agents such as cisplatin monoclonal antibodies glucocorticoids mitotic inhibitors topoisomerase I inhibitors topoisomerase II inhibitors immunomodulating agents such as interferons cellular growth factors cytokines and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory compounds cellular growth factors and kinase inhibitors. Other suitable classifications for chemotherapeutic agents include mitotic inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti estrogenic analogs.

Specific examples of suitable biological and chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to cisplatin carmustine BCNU 5 fluorouracil 5 FU cytarabine Ara C gemcitabine methotrexate daunorubicin doxorubicin dexamethasone topotecan etoposide paclitaxel vincristine tamoxifen TNF alpha TRAIL interferon in both its alpha and beta forms thalidomide and melphalan. Other specific examples of suitable chemotherapeutic agents include nitrogen mustards such as cyclophosphamide alkyl sulfonates nitrosoureas ethylenimines triazenes folate antagonists purine analogs pyrimidine analogs anthracyclines bleomycins mitomycins dactinomycins plicamycin vinca alkaloids epipodophyllotoxins taxanes glucocorticoids L asparaginase estrogens androgens progestins luteinizing hormones octreotide actetate hydroxyurea procarbazine mitotane hexamethylmelamine carboplatin mitoxantrone monoclonal antibodies levamisole interferons interleukins filgrastim and sargramostim. Chemotherapeutic compositions also comprise other members i.e. other than TRAIL of the TNF superfamily of compounds.

Another embodiment of the present invention relates to the use of a compound or composition of the present invention in combination with topoismerase inhibitors to potentiate their apoptotic inducing effect. Topoisomerase inhibitors inhibit DNA replication and repair thereby promoting apoptosis and have been used as chemothemotherapeutic agents. Topoisomerase inhibitors promote DNA damage by inhibiting the enzymes that are required in the DNA repair process. Therefore export of Smac from the mitochondria into the cell cytosol is provoked by the DNA damage caused by topoisomerase inhibitors. Topoisomerase inhibitors of both the Type I class camptothecin topotecan SN 38 irinotecan active metabolite and the Type II class etoposide are expected to show potent synergy with compounds of the present invention. Further examples of topoisomerase inhibiting agents that may be used include but are not limited to irinotecan topotecan etoposide amsacrine exatecan gimatecan etc. Other topoisomerase inhibitors include for example Aclacinomycin A camptothecin daunorubicin doxorubicin ellipticine epirubicin and mitaxantrone.

In another embodiment of the invention the chemotherapeutic anti neoplastic agent for use in combination with the compounds and compositions of the present invention may be a platinum containing compound. In one embodiment of the invention the platinum containing compound is cisplatin. Cisplatin can synergize with a compound of the present invention and potentiate the inhibition of an IAP such as but not limited to XIAP cIAP 1 c IAP 2 ML IAP etc. In another embodiment a platinum containing compound is carboplatin. Carboplatin can synergize with a compound of the present invention and potentiate the inhibition of an IAP including but not limited to XIAP cIAP 1 c IAP 2 ML IAP etc. In another embodiment a platinum containing compound is oxaliplatin. The oxaliplatin can synergize with a compound of the present invention and potentiate the inhibition of an IAP including but not limited to XIAP cIAP 1 c IAP 2 ML IAP etc.

Platinum chemotherapy drugs belong to a general group of DNA modifying agents. DNA modifying agents may be any highly reactive chemical compound that bonds with various nucleophilic groups in nucleic acids and proteins and cause mutagenic carcinogenic or cytotoxic effects. DNA modifying agents work by different mechanisms disruption of DNA function and cell death DNA damage the formation of cross bridges or bonds between atoms in the DNA and induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations to achieve the same end result. Three non limiting examples of a platinum containing DNA modifying agents are cisplatin carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

Cisplatin is believed to kill cancer cells by binding to DNA and interfering with its repair mechanism eventually leading to cell death. Carboplatin and oxaliplatin are cisplatin derivatives that share the same mechanism of action. Highly reactive platinum complexes are formed intracellularly and inhibit DNA synthesis by covalently binding DNA molecules to form intrastrand and interstrand DNA crosslinks.

Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs have been shown to induce apoptosis in colorectal cells. NSAIDs appear to induce apoptosis via the release of Smac from the mitochondria PNAS Nov. 30 2004 vol. 101 16897 16902 . Therefore the use of NSAIDs in combination with the compounds and compositions of the present invention would be expected to increase the activity of each drug over the activity of either drug independently.

Many naturally occurring compounds isolated from bacterial plant and animals can display potent and selective biological activity in humans including anticancer and antineoplastic activities. In fact many natural products or semi synthetic derivatives thereof which possess anticancer activity are already commonly used as therapeutic agents these include paclitaxel etoposide vincristine and camptothecin amongst others. Additionally there are many other classes of natural products such as the indolocarbazoles and epothilones that are undergoing clinical evaluation as anticancer agents. A reoccurring structural motif in many natural products is the attachment of one or more sugar residues onto an aglycone core structure. In some instances the sugar portion of the natural product is critical for making discrete protein ligand interactions at its site of action i.e. pharmacodynamics and removal of the sugar residue results in significant reductions in biological activity. In other cases the sugar moiety or moieties are important for modulating the physical and pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule. Rebeccamycin and staurosporine are representative of the sugar linked indolocarbazole family of anticancer natural products with demonstrated anti kinase and anti topoisomerase activity.

Taxanes are anti mitotic mitotic inhibitors or microtubule polymerization agents. Taxanes are characterized as compounds that promote assembly of microtubules by inhibiting tubulin depolymerization thereby blocking cell cycle progression through centrosomal impairment induction of abnormal spindles and suppression of spindle microtubule dynamics. Taxanes include but are not limited to docetaxel and paclitaxel. The unique mechanism of action of taxane is in contrast to other microtubule poisons such as Vinca alkaloids colchicine and cryptophycines which inhibit tubulin polymerization. Microtubules are highly dynamic cellular polymers made of alpha beta tubulin and associated proteins that play key roles during mitosis by participating in the organization and function of the spindle assuring the integrity of the segregated DNA. Therefore they represent an effective target for cancer therapy.

Yet another embodiment of the present invention is the therapeutic combination or the therapeutic use in combination of a compound or composition of the present invention with TRAIL or other chemical or biological agents which bind to and activate the TRAIL receptor s . TRAIL has received considerable attention recently because of the finding that many cancer cell types are sensitive to TRAIL induced apoptosis while most normal cells appear to be resistant to this action of TRAIL. TRAIL resistant cells may arise by a variety of different mechanisms including loss of the receptor presence of decoy receptors or overexpression of FLIP which competes for zymogen caspase 8 binding during DISC formation. In TRAIL resistance a compound or composition of the present invention may increase tumor cell sensitivity to TRAIL leading to enhanced cell death the clinical correlations of which are expected to be increased apoptotic activity in TRAIL resistant tumors improved clinical response increased response duration and ultimately enhanced patient survival rate. In support of this reduction in XIAP levels by in vitro antisense treatment has been shown to cause sensitization of resistant melanoma cells and renal carcinoma cells to TRAIL Chawla Sarkar et al. 2004 . The compounds of the present invention bind to IAPs and inhibit their interaction with caspases therein potentiating TRAIL induced apoptosis.

Compounds and compositions of the present invention also can be used to augment radiation therapy or radiotherapy i.e. the medical use of ionizing radiation as part of cancer treatment to control malignant cells. Although radiotherapy is often used as part of curative therapy it is occasionally used as a palliative treatment where cure is not possible and the aim is for symptomatic relief. Radiotherapy is commonly used for the treatment of tumors. It may be used as the primary therapy. It is also common to combine radiotherapy with surgery and or chemotherapy. The most common tumors treated with radiotherapy are breast cancer prostate cancer rectal cancer head neck cancers gynecological tumors bladder cancer and lymphoma. Radiation therapy is commonly applied just to the localized area involved with the tumor. Often the radiation fields also include the draining lymph nodes. It is possible but uncommon to give radiotherapy to the whole body or entire skin surface. Radiation therapy is usually given daily for up to 35 38 fractions a daily dose is a fraction . These small frequent doses allow healthy cells time to grow back repairing damage inflicted by the radiation. Three main divisions of radiotherapy are external beam radiotherapy or teletherapy brachytherapy or sealed source radiotherapy and unsealed source radiotherapy which are all suitable examples of treatment protocol in the present invention. The differences relate to the position of the radiation source external is outside the body while sealed and unsealed source radiotherapy has radioactive material delivered internally. Brachytherapy sealed sources are usually extracted later while unsealed sources are injected into the body.

Administration of the compounds and compositions of the present invention may occur prior to concurrently with or subsequent to the combination treatment protocol. A variety of administration routes are available. The particular mode selected will depend of course upon the particular chemotherapeutic drug selected the severity of the condition being treated and the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of the invention generally speaking may be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable meaning any mode that produces effective levels of the active compounds without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Such modes of administration include but are not limited to oral rectal topical nasal intradermal inhalation intra peritoneal or parenteral routes. The term parenteral includes subcutaneous intravenous intramuscular or infusion. Intravenous or intramuscular routes are particularly suitable for purposes of the present invention.

It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and the scope of the appended claims.
