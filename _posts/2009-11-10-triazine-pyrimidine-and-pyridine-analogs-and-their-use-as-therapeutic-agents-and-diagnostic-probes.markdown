This is the U.S. national stage of International application PCT IB2009 007404 filed Nov. 10 2009 designating the United States and claims priority to GB 0821219.3 filed Nov. 10 2008.

The invention relates to new therapeutic agents and diagnostic probes including pharmaceutically acceptable salts prodrugs and metabolites thereof which are useful for modulating protein or enzyme activity for modulating cellular activities such as signal transduction proliferation differentiation programmed cell death migration and cytokine secretion. More specifically the invention provides compounds which inhibit regulate detect and or modulate kinase activity in particular phosphoinositide 3 kinase PI3K mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR DNA PK and ATM kinase inhibitor compounds their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof compositions of the new compounds either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and uses of the new compounds either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent in the prophylaxis or treatment of a number of diseases in particular those characterized by the abnormal activity of serine threonine kinases receptor tyrosine kinases and lipid kinases. The invention also relates to methods of using the compounds for in vitro in situ and in vivo diagnosis assay development or treatment of mammalian cells or associated pathological conditions.

Protein kinases participate in the signaling events which control the activation growth differentiation survival and migration of cells in response to extracellular mediators or stimuli including growth factors cytokines or chemokines. In general these kinases are classified in two groups those that preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues and those that preferentially phosphorylate serine and or threonine residues. The tyrosine kinases include membrane spanning growth factor receptors for example the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and cytosolic non receptor kinases including Src family kinases the Syk family kinases and the Tec family kinases.

Inappropriately high protein kinase activity is involved in many diseases including cancer metabolic diseases immunological diseases and inflammatory disorders. This can be caused either directly or indirectly by the failure of control mechanisms due to mutation overexpression or inappropriate activation of the enzyme.

Protein tyrosine kinases both receptor tyrosine kinases and non receptor kinases are essential for the activation and proliferation of cells of the immune system. Among the earliest detectable events upon the immunoreceptor activation in mast cells T cells and B cells is the stimulation of non receptor tyrosine kinases.

Phosphoinositide 3 kinases PI3Ks were early on identified as lipid kinases associated with viral oncogens Whitman et al. 315 239 242 1985 Sugimoto et al. 81 2117 2121 1984 Macara et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81 2728 2732 1984 and for the last 20 years the connection between cancer and PI3K has been further substantiated Cully et al. 6 184 192 2006 Wymann et al. 17 141 149 2005 Vivanco et al. 2 489 501 2002 . PI3Ks have since been recognized to modulate a wide range of cellular activities and to be central to the growth and metabolic control. Genetically modified mice targeting the PI3K pathway and the elucidation of human hereditary disease like Cowden s syndrome tuberous sclerosis ataxia telangiectasia X linked myotubular myopathy and Charcot Marie Tooth neuropathy have provided further insight in the cellular and systemic role of phosphoinositide signaling. Deregulation of phosphoinositide levels and in particular the product of class I PI3Ks PtdIns 3 4 5 P3 is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer chronic inflammation allergy metabolic disease diabetes and cardiovascular problems.

PI3Ks are a family of enzymes which phosphorylate the 3 OH position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides. They have been divided into three classes on the basis of structural features and in vitro lipid substrate specificity Marone et al 1784 159 185 2008 . Class I PI3Ks form heterodimers which consist of one of the four closely related 110 kDa catalytic subunits and an associated regulatory subunit belonging to two distinct families. In vitro they are capable to convert PtdIns to PtdIns 3 P PtdIns 4 P to PtdIns 3 4 P2 and PtdIns 4 5 P2 to PtdIns 3 4 5 P3 but the in vivo substrate is PtdIns 4 5 P2 Cantley et al. Science 296 1655 1657 2002 . Class I PI3Ks are activated by a large variety of cell surface receptors comprising growth factor receptors as well as G protein coupled receptors.

Class II PI3Ks are capable to phosphorylate PtdIns and PtdIns 4 P in vitro but their relevant in vivo substrates are still under investigation. This class of large 170 200 kDa enzymes has three members all characterized by a C terminal C2 homology domain. No adaptor molecules for class II PI3Ks have been identified so far. Class III PI3Ks are solely able to phosphorylate PtdIns and thus generate only PtdIns 3 P. The single member of this class is Vps34 of which the S. cerevisiae Vps34p vacuolar protein sorting mutant 34 protein is the prototype and has been shown to play an essential role in trafficking of newly synthesized proteins from the Golgi to the yeast vacuole an organelle equivalent to lysosomes in mammals Schu et al. Science 260 88 91 1993 .

Phosphoinositide 4 kinases PI4Ks phosphorylate the 4 OH position of the inositol ring of PtdIns and thereby generate PtdIns 4 P. This lipid can then be further phosphorylated by PtdIns 4 P 5 kinases to generate PtdIns 4 5 P2 which is the main source for phospholipase C and PI3K signaling at the plasma membrane. Four PI4Ks isoforms are known PI4KII and and PI4KIII and . The PI4KIIIs are most closely related to PI3Ks.

The class of PI3K related proteins referred to as class IV PI3Ks consists of high molecular weight enzymes with a catalytic core similar to PI3Ks and PI4Ks and include the target of rapamycin mTOR also known as FRAP DNA dependent protein kinase DNA PKcs the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene product ATM ataxia telangiectasiarelated ATR SMG 1 and transformation transcription domain associated protein TRRAP . The first five members are active protein serine threonine kinases that are involved in cell growth control and genome transcriptome surveillance Marone et al. 1784 159 185 2008 . DNA PKcs ATM ATR and SMG 1 are involved in DNA damage responses. The only active kinase not involved in DNA damage is mTOR which is regulated by growth factors and nutrient availability and coordinates protein synthesis cell growth and proliferation. Target of rapamycin mTOR complexes 1 and integrate growth factor signaling via PI3K PKB and the Ras MAPK cascade energy status LKB1 and AMPK and nutrient detection. TOR is positively regulated by PKB Akt which phosphorylates the negative regulator TSC2 in the tuberous sclerosis complex TSC resulting in activation of the GTPase Rheb and mTOR Marone et al. 1784 159 185 2008 . In parallel mTOR stimulates translation of ribosomal proteins and therefore ribosome biogenesis via the activation of p70 Wullschleger et al. 124 471 2006 . Rapamycin and its derivatives RAD001 and CCI 779 bind to FKBP12 and the complex blocks mTOR complex 1 mTORC1 activity very selectively. Various clinical trials were initiated using Rapamycin and derivatives mostly in patients with tumors displaying elevated PI3K signaling and hyperactive mTOR. Promising results were obtained in mantle cell lymphoma endometrial cancer and renal cell carcinoma Guertin et al. 12 9 2007 . Rapamycin and its derivatives possess anti angiogenic activity because they counteract VEGF action Guba et al. 8 128 2002 . This opens avenues for combinatorial treatments with conventional chemotherapy Beuvink et al. 120 747 2005 .

The PI3K pathway is a key signaling transduction cascade controlling the regulation of cell growth proliferation survival as well as cell migration. PI3Ks are activated by a wide variety of different stimuli including growth factors inflammatory mediators hormones neurotransmitters and immunoglobulins and antigens Wymann et al. 24 366 376 2003 . The class IA PI3K isoforms PI3K and are all bound to one of the p85 p55 p50 regulatory subunits which all harbor two SH2 domains that bind with high affinity to phosphorylated Tyr X X Met motifs. These motifs are present in activated growth factor receptors their substrates and numerous adaptor proteins. As described above activation of the PI3K PKB signaling cascade has a positive effect on cell growth survival and proliferation. Constitutive up regulation of PI3K signaling can have a deleterious effect on cells leading to uncontrolled proliferation enhanced migration and adhesion independent growth. These events favor not only the formation of malignant tumors but also the development of inflammatory and autoimmune disease.

The PI3 kinase Akt PTEN pathway is an attractive target for cancer drug development since such agents would be expected to inhibit proliferation reverse the repression of apoptosis and surmount resistance to cytotoxic agente in cancer cells. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been reported see notably Marone et al. 1784 159 185 2008 Yaguchi et al. 2006 Jour. Of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 98 8 545 556 U.S. Pat. No. 7 173 029 U.S. Pat.

Treatment can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.

The phrase therapeutically effective amount means an amount of a compound of the present invention that i treats or prevents the particular disease condition or disorder ii attenuates ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease condition or disorder or iii prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease condition or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may be reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the tumor size inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy efficacy can be measured for example by assessing the time to disease progression TTP and or determining the response rate RR .

The term package insert is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products that contain information about the indications usage dosage administration contraindications and or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.

The term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

The term stereoisomers refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diasteremers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and l or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate.

The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imin enamine isomerizations.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include but are not limited to sulfate citrate acetate oxalate chloride bromide iodide nitrate bisulfate phosphate acid phosphate isonicotinate lactate salicylate acid citrate tartrate oleate tannate pantothenate bitartrate ascorbate succinate maleate gentisinate fumarate gluconate glucuronate saccharate formate benzoate glutamate methanesulfonate mesylate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate p toluenesulfonate and pamoate salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and or one or more counter ion.

If the compound of the invention is a base the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art for example treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid methanesulfonic acid phosphoric acid and the like or with an organic acid such as acetic acid trifluoroacetic acid maleic acid succinic acid mandelic acid fumaric acid malonic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid glycolic acid salicylic acid a pyranosidyl acid such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid an alpha hydroxyl acid such as citric acid or tartaric acid an amino acid such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid an aromatic acid such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid a sulfonic acid such as p toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid or the like.

If the compound of the invention is an acid the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method for example treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base such as an amine an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or the like. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include but are not limited to organic salts derived from amino acids such as glycine and arginine ammonia primary secondary and tertiary amines and cyclic amines such as piperidine morpholine and piperazine and inorganic salts derived from sodium calcium potassium magnesium manganese iron copper zinc aluminium and lithium.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and or toxicologically with the other ingredients comprising a formulation and or the mammal being treated therewith.

A solvate refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include but are not limited to water isopropanol ethanol methanol DMSO ethyl acetate acetic acid and ethanolamine. The term hydrate refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.

The term protecting group refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound. For example an amino protecting group is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino protecting groups include acetyl trifluoroacetyl t butoxycarbonyl BOC benzyloxycarbonyl and 9 fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl Fmoc .

In the methods of preparing the compounds of this invention it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps are separated and or purified hereinafter separated to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture distillation sublimation or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including for example reverse phase and normal phase size exclusion ion exchange high medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus small scale analytical simulated moving bed SMB and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.

Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product unreacted starting material reaction by product or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon molecular sieves ion exchange media or the like. Alternatively the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material bases in the case of an acidic material binding reagents such as antibodies binding proteins selective chelators such as crown ethers liquid liquid ion extraction reagents LIX or the like.

Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.

Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher s acid chloride separating the diastereomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers e.g. substituted biaryls and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.

A single stereoisomer e.g. an enantiomer substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994 Lochmuller C. H. 1975 J. Chromatogr. 113 3 283 302 . Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method including 1 formation of ionic diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods 2 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents separation of the diastereomers and conversion to the pure stereoisomers and 3 separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See Drug Stereochemistry Analytical Methods and Pharmacology Irving W. Wainer Ed. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1993 .

Under method 1 diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine quinine ephedrine strychnine methyl phenylethylamine amphetamine and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids such as camphorsulfonic acid tartaric acid mandelic acid or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.

Alternatively by method 2 the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. 1994 p. 322 . Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents such as menthyl derivatives followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters such as a menthyl ester e.g. menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base or Mosher ester methoxy trifluoromethyl phenyl acetate Jacob III. J. Org. Chem. 1982 47 4165 of the racemic mixture and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal and reverse phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl isoquinolines WO96 15111 . By method 3 a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase Chiral Liquid Chromatography 1989 W. J. Lough Ed. Chapman and Hall New York Okamoto J. Chromatogr. 1990 513 375 378 . Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.

Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub dose as herein above recited or an appropriate fraction thereof of the active ingredient.

The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally orally or by any other desired route.

The compounds of the invention may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein such as a hyperproliferative disorder e.g. cancer . In certain embodiments a compound of formula Ia d is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen as combination therapy with a second compound that has anti hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating a hyperproliferative disorder e.g. cancer . The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of formula Ia d such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment a composition of this invention comprises a compound of formula Ia d or a stereoisomer geometric isomer tautomer solvate metabolite a N oxide derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent such as described herein.

The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.

Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.

The combination therapy may provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes separate pills or capsules or separate infusions. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.

In a particular embodiment of anti cancer therapy a compound of formula Ia d or a stereoisomer geometric isomer tautomer solvate metabolite N oxide derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof may be combined with other chemotherapeutic hormonal or antibody agents such as those described herein as well as combined with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of formula Ia d or a stereoisomer geometric isomer tautomer solvate metabolite N oxide derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. The amounts of the compound s of formula Ia d and the other pharmaceutically active chemotherapeutic agent s and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.

Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of formulas I and Ia to Ii described herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation reduction hydrolysis amidation deamidation esterification deesterification enzymatic cleavage and the like of the administered compound. Accordingly the invention includes metabolites of compounds of formulas I and Ia to Ii including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.

Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabeled e.g. C or H isotope of a compound of the invention administering it parenterally in a detectable dose e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg kg to an animal such as rat mouse guinea pig monkey or to man allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours and isolating its conversion products from the urine blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite . The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion e.g. by MS LC MS or NMR analysis. In general analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.

In addition to compounds of the invention the invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of such compounds. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue or a polypeptide chain of two or more e.g. two three or four amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine phosphothreonine phosphotyrosine 4 hydroxyproline hydroxylysine demosine isodemosine gamma carboxyglutamate hippuric acid octahydroindole 2 carboxylic acid statine 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid penicillamine ornithine 3 methylhistidine norvaline beta alanine gamma aminobutyric acid citrulline homocysteine homoserine methyl alanine para benzoylphenylalanine phenylglycine propargylglycine sarcosine methionine sulfone and tert butylglycine.

Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance a free carboxyl group of a compound of the invention can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as but not limited to a phosphate ester hemisuccinate dimethylaminoacetate or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group as outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 1996 19 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included as are carbonate prodrugs sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as acyloxy methyl and acyloxy ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including but not limited to ether amine and carboxylic acid functionalities or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem. 1996 39 10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 Ci C alkanoyloxy ethyl 1 methyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl Ci C alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl N C C alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl succinoyl CrC alkanoyl amino C C alkanoyl arylacyl and aminoacyl or aminoacyl aminoacyl where each aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L amino acids P O OH P O O C C alkyl or glycosyl the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate . 00196 For additional examples of prodrug derivatives see for example a Design of Prodrugs edited by H.

Inhibitor efficacy of formula I compounds were measured by a cell assay employing the following protocol 

Cells were plated in black 96 well view plates Packard 24 hours prior to the experiment. Inhibitor or DMSO as control were added to the medium each sample as duplicates and incubated for 3 hours. 4 para formaldehyde was applied for 20 minutes at room temperature to fix the cells. After washing with PBS 0.1 Triton X 100 blocking with 10 goat serum in PBS was done for 1 hour. On a shaker antibodies diluted in PBS against pPKB Ser473 Cell Signalling and PKB gift from E. Hirsch or pS6 Ser 235 236 Cell Signalling were incubated overnight at 4 C. After washing with PBS secondary antibodies LI COR diluted in PBS were applied at room temperature in the dark. Plates were washed with PBS prior to scanning on an Odyssey reader.

The more phosphorylated PKB was measured on the Odyssey scan the higher the pPKB PKB values were i.e. the less strong was inhibition of signalling. A summary of the results obtained for some exemplary compounds is depicted in table 7.

Assessment of compound permeability was indirectly intepretated by using this assay. The compounds were applied to the apical surface of cell monolayers and compound permeation into the cellular compartment could be interpretated by measuring the inhibition of PI3Ks.
