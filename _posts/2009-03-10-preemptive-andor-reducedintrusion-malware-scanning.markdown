The present invention relates generally to computer security and more particularly but not exclusively to methods and apparatus for scanning computer data for malicious contents.

Computer viruses worms Trojans rootkits and spyware are examples of malicious codes that have plagued computer systems throughout the world. Although there are technical differences between each type of malicious code malicious codes are also collectively referred to as malware or viruses. Malware scanning or antivirus products for protecting computers against malicious codes are commercially available. Experienced computer users have installed some form of antivirus in their computers.

A typical malware scanning product includes a scan engine and a pattern file. The pattern file comprises patterns for identifying known malicious codes. To check a file for malicious code the scan engine opens the file and compares its content to patterns in the pattern file. The pattern file needs to be updated to address newly discovered malicious codes. As the number of known malicious codes increases so does the size of the pattern file. The larger the pattern file the more memory and processing resources are consumed to perform malicious code scanning.

One embodiment relates to a computer implemented method of preemptively scanning targets for malicious codes. Input qualities regarding said targets are received. A first computer implemented procedure is applied to generate a measure of priority for scanning of said targets. Targets are selected for preemptive scanning using said measure of priority.

In another embodiment resource utilization inputs are also received and a second computer implemented procedure may be applied to determine a system resource usage level using the resource utilization inputs. In this case the malware scanning may be performed opportunistically based on the system resource usage level.

Another embodiment relates to an apparatus configured to scan targets for malicious code. Data storage is configured to store computer readable code and data and a processor is configured to execute computer readable code and to access said data storage. A scheduling engine is configured to receive input qualities regarding said targets and apply a first computer implemented procedure to generate a measure of priority for scanning of said targets. In addition a scan manager is configured to select targets for preemptive scanning using said measure of priority.

In another embodiment the apparatus also includes a resource monitor which is configured to receive resource utilization inputs. The resource monitor is further configured to apply a second computer implemented procedure to determine a system resource usage level using the resource utilization input. In this case the scan manager may be further configured to opportunistically schedule malware scanning based on the system resource usage level.

These and other features of the present invention will be readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the entirety of this disclosure which includes the accompanying drawings and claims.

Malware scanning products generally scan targets to determine whether they contain malware including computer viruses worms and so on or lead to malicious sites. As used herein a target for malware scanning may be a file or universal resource locator URL . A target may be scanned locally by the host computer system or remotely by way of an in the cloud look up or scan.

In existing malware scanning products targets are generally scanned either when they are created or modified or when they are opened. Applicants believe that this conventional method of scanning has the following disadvantages and problems.

First the conventional method of scanning requires an increasingly large amount of resources of a computer system. When the targets are scanned the scanning process typically uses a significant amount of CPU and memory resources. The amount of system resources required for malware scanning is increasing with the increasing size of files and disk storage systems. This disadvantageously reduces the amount available to other applications and frequently results in noticeably slower performance of those other applications.

Second the conventional method of scanning results in inefficient repetitive scanning. For example the conventional method scans a file each time it is accessed. Hence when a file is accessed multiple times it is scanned multiple times even if the file is unmodified between scans and there are no intervening updates to the security software.

Third malware scanning may have latencies due to the need to access network resources. For example a security product may perform an in the cloud look up of a knowledge base to determine a reputation of a specific target. Such a look up typically slows down the scanning process due to network latencies. As a result performance is further impacted from the point of view of a user.

Fourth the intrusive nature of malware scanning often results in incomplete scans. This is because a user often prefers not to complete a scan whether manual on demand or scheduled because the system is practically unusable during the scan. As a result of incomplete scans the system becomes more vulnerable to malware attacks.

One embodiment of the present invention provides a method and apparatus for preemptive scheduling of targets for malware scanning. The scheduling of targets for scanning is done in a preemptive way based on a set of qualities for the targets. The set of qualities may include one or more properties of the target which provide predictive value as to how soon the target would conventionally need to be scanned for example due to the target being accessed. Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method and apparatus for opportunistic malware scanning. The opportunistic malware scanning is performed based upon monitoring of system resource usage. In another embodiment of the present invention the opportunistic malware scanning may be combined with the preemptive scheduling of targets for malware scanning.

The input qualities may include one or more of the following the frequency at which a target has been accessed the last time at which the target s content was modified the frequency at which the target s content has been modified an estimation of the likelihood of the target carrying malware this may be based on file type for example an estimation of time and or CPU resource and or disk space required to fetch and scan data for the target a percentage scan completion if a target has been partially scanned and age of the target s content for example based on time to live or TTL data .

In addition the input qualities may include source information and or information about past scan results for a target. The source information may indicate for example that the target was downloaded from an electronic mail message from a USB device from a web browser or by a particular application. The information about past scan results may comprise for example an approval rating based on past scan results for the target.

The input qualities may also include other target related characteristics. These characteristics may include for example the file name file type file size file path and file creation time for those targets that are files .

The input qualities may further include select target related events which are tracked by the scheduling engine . Such events may comprise for example file access events product updates and completed scan results. File access events include the use and or modification of a file. The scheduling engine may track the time of the access whether the access used and or modified the file and which application performed the access. The tracking data may be stored and used by the scheduling engine . The monitored events may include for example the following system activities a process related activities including creating a process opening a process and terminating a process cleanup b file related activities including creating a file for reading opening a file for reading deleting a file cleanup creating a file for writing opening a file for writing and closing a file c registry related activities including creating a registry key or value setting a registry key or value and deleting a registry key or value cleanup and d application programming interface API related activities including calling into an API.

The weights may be used to rank the scan targets. For example a lower weight may indicate a higher priority target for scanning i.e. a higher urgency for scanning the target . In that case a target with a lower weight would rank higher in priority than a target with a higher weight. In an alternate implementation a higher weight may indicate a lower priority target for scanning. In that case a target with a higher weight would rank higher in priority than a target with a lower weight. 

A prioritized target table may be output and or updated by the scheduling engine . The following is a table indicating example information that may be included in the prioritized target table .

Of course other embodiments of the prioritized target table may include fields that vary from the specific fields shown in Table 1. For example the size of the target may be included instead of the estimated scan time. As another example in one embodiment the table may include the weight priority field but not the estimated scan time field. In other embodiments other additional fields may be included in the table.

The prioritized target table may be used to preemptively select or schedule scan targets by a scan manager . For example the scan manager may be configured to simply select or schedule targets in the order indicated by weight priority field in the prioritized target table . A malware scan engine performs the scans on the targets.

The input qualities are received by the scheduling engine . The scheduling engine applies a computer implemented procedure to rate targets for preemptive malware scanning. Based on the ratings of the targets the prioritized target table is generated and or updated . The prioritized target table may be used by the scan manager to select or schedule targets for preemptive scanning by the malware scan module .

Advantageously the preemptive scheduling technique described above enables targets that are more likely to be malware to be scanned before targets that are less likely to be malware. This makes it more likely that malware will be detected earlier by the scanner.

In order to perform the monitoring the resource monitor receives resource utilization inputs . The resource utilization inputs may include for example CPU usage memory usage and disk input output usage. In addition the resource utilization inputs may include network bandwidth usage. While the resource monitor is shown as part of the scan manager in a module external to the scan manager may also be used.

In one embodiment when the resource monitor detects a low level of resource usage by the computer system the malware scanning module may be allowed to perform its scanning of targets in a normal manner. However when the resource monitor detects a high level of resource usage by the computer system the scan manager may be configured to pause the malware scanning of targets during this period of high resource usage. In one implementation a high level of resource usage may be indicated when a set usage limit for one or more system resources for example the CPU memory or disk storage or network bandwidth for in the cloud look ups is exceeded.

The resource utilization inputs are received by the resource monitor . The resource monitor applies a computer implemented procedure to determine a resource usage level or resource usage levels . The resource usage level s may be used by the scan manager to control the malware scan module so as to opportunistically scan targets during periods of lower resource usage.

The opportunistic technique described above enables the malware scanning module to avoid taking up scarce system resources during periods of high resource usage. This advantageously reduces or minimizes intrusion or interference with other processes which a user may be actively running.

As shown in a scheduling engine is configured to receive input qualities regarding targets for malware scanning. In one embodiment the scheduling engine may utilize an external module or application for collecting or for assisting in collecting the input qualities . The scheduling engine is further configured to determine weights or scores for the scan targets based on the input qualities . The input qualities may include various target related data and characteristics and may further include select target related events which are tracked by the scheduling engine . The tracking data may be stored and used by the scheduling engine . A prioritized target table may be output and or updated by the scheduling engine . For example as shown above in Table 1 the prioritized target table may include the weight for a target where a lower weight indicates a higher priority for scanning and the estimated scan time for a target. Of course other embodiments of the prioritized target table may include fields that vary from the specific fields shown in Table 1.

As further shown in a resource monitor of a scan manager monitors usage of the system resources. The monitoring is performed so as to determine opportunistic times for a malware scan module to perform malware scanning of targets with minimal or reduced impact to the computer user s experience. In order to perform the monitoring the resource monitor receives and processes resource utilization inputs . The resource utilization inputs may include for example CPU usage memory usage disk input output usage and or network bandwidth usage. While the resource monitor is shown as part of the scan manager in a module external to the scan manager may also be used.

The input qualities are received by the scheduling engine . The scheduling engine applies a computer implemented procedure to prioritize targets. Based on the ratings of the targets the prioritized target table is generated and or updated .

In addition resource utilization inputs are received by a resource monitor of a scan engine . The resource monitor applies a computer implemented procedure to determine a system resource usage level or levels using the resource utilization inputs .

The resource usage level s and the prioritized target table are used by the scan manager so that malware scanning is performed in a preemptive and opportunistic manner. For example consider the following cases.

In a first case the resource monitor may detect that usage of resources by the computer system indicates a low level of usage. In this case the scan manager may select as a next target to be scanned the highest priority target from the prioritized target table . For example consider the prioritized target table given in Table 1. In this example the scan manager selects FileR.exe as the next target to be scanned because FileR.exe is the highest priority target indicated by the table. When the scan of FileR.exe is completed it is removed from the table and the highest priority target remaining in the table is selected as the next target. And so on. In this case malware scanning is advantageously performed in a preemptive manner in order of priority rather than in a non prioritized order.

In a second case the resource monitor may detect that usage of resources by the computer system indicates a high level of usage. For example a set usage limit for one or more system resources for example the CPU memory or disk storage or network bandwidth for in the cloud look ups is being exceeded by the computer system. In this case the scan manager may be configured to pause the malware scanning of targets during this period of high resource usage. This advantageously enables the malware scanning to be performed while reducing or minimizing intrusion or interference with other applications which a user may be actively running.

In a third case the resource monitor may detect an intermediate level of resource usage by the computer system. In this case the scan manager may select as a next target to be scanned the highest priority target under a threshold estimated scan time from the prioritized target table . For example consider the prioritized target table given in Table 1 and assume a threshold for the estimated scan time of fifty milliseconds. In this example the scan manager selects FileM.exe as the next target to be scanned because FileM.exe is the highest priority target with an estimated scan time under the threshold. FileR.exe and Fileb.vbs have higher priorities but they have estimated scan times over the threshold. When the scan of FileM.exe is completed it is removed from the table and the highest priority target remaining in the table with estimated scan time under the threshold is selected as the next target. And so on. In this case scanning of rapidly scanned usually small size targets is performed in a prioritized order while avoiding undue intrusion or interference with other applications which a user may be actively running.

Advantageously the above described technique enables targets that are more likely to be malware to be scanned before targets that are less likely to be malware. Furthermore this technique enables the performance of malware scanning in a manner which avoids taking up scarce system resources during periods of high resource usage.
