This is a continuation in part application of International Patent Application PCT US2008 054014 filed Feb. 14 2008 designating the United States and published in English as WO 2008 101118 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 901 455 filed on Feb. 14 2007. The entire contents of these prior applications are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with government support under contract CA083639 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

This disclosure relates to the field of ovarian cancer and in particular to methods for treating ovarian cancer by targeting ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules identified by an ovarian tumor endothelial cell gene expression profile and methods for identifying therapeutic agents.

Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common form of cancer in women in the United States accounting for three percent of the total number of cancer cases and twenty six percent of those occurring in the female genital tract. The American Cancer Society estimated that 15 310 deaths would be caused in women living in the United States in 2006. A large majority of women who die of ovarian cancer will have had serous carcinoma of the ovarian epithelium a condition which occurs in sixty percent of all cases of ovarian cancer Boring et al. 44 7 26 1994 .

Women with ovarian cancer are typically asymptomatic until the cancer has metastasized. As a result most women with ovarian cancer are not diagnosed until the cancer has progressed to an advanced and usually incurable stage Boente et al. 20 83 137 1996 . Survival rates are much better in women diagnosed with early stage ovarian cancers about ninety percent of these women are still alive five years after diagnosis.

Treatment of ovarian cancer typically involves a variety of treatment modalities. Generally surgical intervention serves as the basis for treatment Dennis S Chi William J. Hoskins in 241 Stephen C. Rubin Gregory P. Sutton eds. 2d ed. 2001 . Treatment of serous carcinoma often involves cytoreductive surgery hysterectomy bilateral salpingo oophorectomy omentectomy and lymphadenectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and either cisplatin or carboplatin Eltabbakh G. H. Awtrey C. S. 2 10 109 24 2001 .

Despite a clinical response rate of 80 to primary treatment with surgery and chemotherapy most subjects experience tumor recurrence within two years of treatment. The overwhelming majority of subjects will eventually develop chemoresistance and die as a result of their cancer. Thus a need exists to identify alternative treatments for ovarian cancer.

A gene profiling signature is disclosed herein that can be used to predict clinical outcome and develop therapeutics for treating ovarian cancer in a subject. For example the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules identified by the gene profile signature can serve as prognostic indicators as well as targets for specific therapeutic molecules that can reduce or eliminate ovarian cancer. Thus methods of identifying an agent for treating an ovarian tumor are provided. In some examples the methods include contacting a cell such as an ovarian tumor cell or an ovarian tumor endothelial cell with one or more test agents under conditions sufficient for the one or more test agents to alter the activity of at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule listed in any of Tables 1 5. The method includes detecting the activity of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the presence and absence of the one or more test agents. The activity of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the presence of the one or more test agents is then compared to the activity in the absence of such agents to determine if there is differential expression of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule. Differential expression of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the presence of the test agent s indicates that the one or more test agents can be used to treat an ovarian tumor.

Methods are also provided for treating an ovarian tumor. In some examples the method includes administering to the subject a therapeutically effective treatment to inhibit ovarian tumor growth. In an example the treatment includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of a specific binding agent that binds with high specificity to one of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Tables 1 2 4 or 5 and alters expression or activity of the molecules thereby treating the ovarian tumor in the subject for example by decreasing tumor vascular growth tumor growth or tumor volume . In particular examples the specific binding agent preferentially binds to and inhibits expression or activity of one of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that is upregulated in an ovarian tumor endothelial cell such as Zeste homologue 2 EZH2 EGF like domain multiple 6 EGFL6 tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 6 TNFAIP6 Twist homologue 1 TWIST1 stanniocalcin 1 STC1 homeodomain only protein HOP chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 2 CSPG2 and plexin domain containing 1 PLXDC1 . In other particular examples ovarian tumor growth is inhibited by the specific binding agent preferentially binding to and inhibiting expression of one of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in any of Tables 1 2 4 or 5 which are involved in angiogenesis such as molecules involved in cell proliferation tube formation or cell motility and are upregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells.

Methods are also provided for determining the effectiveness of an agent for the treatment of an ovarian tumor in a subject with the ovarian tumor. In an example the method includes detecting expression of an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in a sample from the subject following administration of the agent. The expression of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule following administration is compared to a control such as specific binding agents that bind to and inhibit one of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in any of Tables 1 2 4 or 5 that is upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells. An alteration in the expression of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule such as a decrease in expression of a molecule upregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells or an increase in expression of a molecule downregulated in such cells following treatment indicates that the agent is effective for the treatment of the ovarian cancer in the subject. In a specific example the method includes detecting and comparing the protein expression levels of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. In other examples the method includes detecting and comparing the mRNA expression levels of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules.

Methods of diagnosing and prognosing an ovarian tumor such as a tumor that overexpresses at least one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules are provided. In some examples such methods are performed prior to the treatment methods described herein. However such methods can also be used independently of the disclosed treatment methods. In particular examples the method includes determining the metastatic potential of an ovarian tumor in a subject by detecting expression of at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in a sample obtained from a subject with an ovarian tumor. The at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule is involved in promoting angiogenesis such as cell proliferation cell motility or tube formation such as EZH2. The method further includes comparing expression of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the sample obtained from the subject with the ovarian tumor to a control. An alteration in the expression of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule involved in promoting angiogenesis indicates that the subject has an ovarian tumor with increased metastatic potential.

In additional examples methods are disclosed for predicting a clinical outcome in a subject with an ovarian tumor such as advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer. In an example the methods include detecting expression of at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Tables 1 5 or combinations thereof such as at least 1 at least 3 at least 5 or at least 10 of such molecules in a sample obtained from the subject with the ovarian tumor. The methods also can include comparing expression of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the sample obtained from the subject with the ovarian tumor to a control such as a normal sample or value representing such expression expected in a normal sample wherein an alteration in the expression of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule indicates that the subject has a decreased chance of survival. For example an alteration in the expression such as an increase in the expression of EZH2 indicates a poor prognosis such as a decreased chance of survival. In one example a decreased chance of survival includes a survival time of equal to or less than a year. Alterations in the expression can be measured using methods known in the art and this disclosure is not limited to particular methods. For example expression can be measured at the nucleic acid level such as by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or microarray analysis or at the protein level such as by Western blot analysis .

The foregoing and other features of the disclosure will become more apparent from the following detailed description of several embodiments which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.

The nucleic and amino acid sequences listed in the accompanying sequence listing are shown using standard letter abbreviations for nucleotide bases and three letter code for amino acids as defined in 37 C.F.R. 1.822. Only one strand of each nucleic acid sequence is shown but the complementary strand is understood as included by any reference to the displayed strand. In the accompanying sequence listing 

Despite improvements in surgery and chemotherapy mortality rates in women with advanced ovarian carcinoma have remained largely unchanged Cannistra 329 1550 1559 1993 . Therefore novel therapeutic strategies are needed. Growth of tumors both at the primary and metastatic sites requires a blood supply for expansion beyond 1 2 mm Folkman 82 4 6 1990 . Targeting tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting endothelial cells that support tumor growth is particularly promising because of their presumed genetic stability. The recent success of a humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab trade name Avastin against vascular endothelial growth factor in prolonging the lives of patients with advanced colon and breast carcinoma demonstrates the promise of such approaches Hurwitz et al. 350 2335 2342 2004 and Jain et al. 3 24 40 2006 . However the full spectrum of differences in the tumor vasculature compared to its normal counterpart is not known. Identification of additional targets on tumor endothelium may allow opportunities for developing new therapeutic approaches to inhibit angiogenesis in a tumor specific manner.

In recent years whole genome expression profiling of cancer using methods such as microarray and serial analysis of gene expression SAGE have provided insight into the molecular pathways involved in cancer onset and progression. While selected genes in ovarian cancer vasculature have been characterized there is little information regarding global gene expression alterations in ovarian cancer endothelium.

Disclosed herein is a gene expression signature identifying endothelial cell tumor associated molecules in ovarian tumor endothelial cell isolates. Endothelial cells were purified from human ovarian tissues and invasive ovarian epithelial cancers and a gene expression profile was established for ovarian tumor endothelial cells using microarray analyses. The gene expression profile disclosed herein identifies genes whose expression is differentially regulated in tumor versus normal endothelial cells. This profile reveals distinct expression profiles for tumor endothelial cell isolates as compared to non tumor endothelial isolates.

The disclosed gene expression profile also reveals genes and collections or sets of genes that serve as effective molecular markers for angiogenesis in ovarian cancer predict clinical outcome as well as such genes or gene sets that can provide clinically effective therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer. This has significant implications for the treatment of ovarian cancer. For example methods are disclosed for treating ovarian cancer for example reducing or inhibiting ovarian cancer growth by targeting ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules such as molecules believed to be involved in angiogenesis . For example molecules involved in cell motility tube formation or cell proliferation can be identified by the gene profile signature. In an example a therapeutically effective amount of a specific binding agent is administered to a subject. For example the specific binding agent preferentially binds to one or more of the identified ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in any of Tables 1 2 4 5 or a combination thereof to alter the expression or activity of such molecule e.g. increase expression or activity of a molecule that is downregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells or decrease expression or activity of a molecule that is upregulated in such cells . In one example the specific binding agent preferentially binds to one or more of the identified ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in any of Tables 1 2 4 5 or a combination thereof that are upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells as indicated by a positive fold change in Table 1 to decrease expression or activity of the one or more molecules. As a result ovarian cancer in the subject is thereby reduced or eliminated. In a particular example the specific binding agent is an inhibitor such as a siRNA of one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules described in any of Table 1 2 4 or 5 whose expression is upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells such as EZH2. In some examples the specific binding agent preferentially binds to one or more of the identified ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in any of Tables 1 2 4 5 or a combination thereof that are downregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells as indicated by a negative fold change in Table 1 to increase expression or activity of the one or more molecules. As a result ovarian cancer in the subject is thereby reduced or eliminated.

The following explanations of terms and methods are provided to better describe the present disclosure and to guide those of ordinary skill in the art in the practice of the present disclosure. The singular forms a an and the refer to one or more than one unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example the term comprising a nucleic acid molecule includes single or plural nucleic acid molecules and is considered equivalent to the phrase comprising at least one nucleic acid molecule. The term or refers to a single element of stated alternative elements or a combination of two or more elements unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. As used herein comprises means includes. Thus comprising A or B means including A B or A and B without excluding additional elements.

Unless explained otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure suitable methods and materials are described below. The materials methods and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.

To provide or give a subject an agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent by any effective route. Exemplary routes of administration include but are not limited to injection such as subcutaneous intramuscular intradermal intraperitoneal and intravenous oral sublingual rectal transdermal intranasal vaginal and inhalation routes.

Any protein nucleic acid molecule compound small molecule organic compound inorganic compound or other molecule of interest. Agent can include a therapeutic agent a diagnostic agent or a pharmaceutical agent. A therapeutic or pharmaceutical agent is one that alone or together with an additional compound induces the desired response such as inducing a therapeutic or prophylactic effect when administered to a subject . In a particular example a pharmaceutical agent such as a siRNA to any of the genes listed in Tables 2 and Table 4 significantly reduces angiogenesis. A test agent is any substance including but not limited to a protein such as an antibody nucleic acid molecule such as a siRNA organic compound inorganic compound or other molecule of interest. In particular examples a test agent can permeate a cell membrane alone or in the presence of a carrier .

To increase the number of copies of a nucleic acid molecule such as a gene or fragment of a gene for example a region of an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated gene. The resulting products are called amplification products.

An example of in vitro amplification is the polymerase chain reaction PCR in which a biological sample obtained from a subject such as a sample containing ovarian cancer cells is contacted with a pair of oligonucleotide primers under conditions that allow for hybridization of the primers to a nucleic acid molecule in the sample. The primers are extended under suitable conditions dissociated from the template and then re annealed extended and dissociated to amplify the number of copies of the nucleic acid molecule. Other examples of in vitro amplification techniques include quantitative real time PCR strand displacement amplification see U.S. Pat. No. 5 744 311 transcription free isothermal amplification see U.S. Pat. No. 6 033 881 repair chain reaction amplification see WO 90 01069 ligase chain reaction amplification see EP A 320 308 gap filling ligase chain reaction amplification see U.S. Pat. No. 5 427 930 coupled ligase detection and PCR see U.S. Pat. No. 6 027 889 and NASBA RNA transcription free amplification see U.S. Pat. No. 6 025 134 .

A commonly used method for real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction involves the use of a double stranded DNA dye such as SYBR Green I dye . For example as the amount of PCR product increases more SYBR Green I dye binds to DNA resulting in a steady increase in fluorescence. Another commonly used method is real time quantitative TaqMan PCR Applied Biosystems . The 5 nuclease assay provides a real time method for detecting only specific amplification products. The use of fluorogenic probes makes it possible to eliminate post PCR processing for the analysis of probe degradation. The probe is an oligonucleotide with both a reporter fluorescent dye and a quencher dye attached. While the probe is intact the proximity of the quencher greatly reduces the fluorescence emitted by the reporter dye by F rster resonance energy transfer FRET through space. Probe design and synthesis has been simplified by the finding that adequate quenching is observed for probes with the reporter at the 5 end and the quencher at the 3 end.

A physiological process involving the growth of new blood vessels from pre existing vessels. Angiogenesis can occur under normal physiological conditions such as during growth and development or wound healing known as physiological angiogenesis as well as pathological conditions such as in the transition of tumors from a dormant state to a malignant state known as pathological angiogenesis . As used herein pro angiogenic genes are genes that facilitate angiogenesis such as angiogenesis in an ovarian tumor.

The complex phenomenon of angiogenesis begins with degradation of the basement membrane by cellular proteases. This allows endothelial cells to penetrate and migrate process known as cell motility into the extracellular matrix and then proliferate. In the final stages of this process the endothelial cells align themselves to form capillary or tubelike structures process known as tube formation . These new structures then form a network that undergoes significant remodeling and rearrangement before fully functioning capillaries exist. Therefore angiogenesis can be studied or identified by monitoring tube formation cell motility and or cell proliferation.

A polypeptide ligand including at least a light chain or heavy chain immunoglobulin variable region which specifically recognizes and binds an epitope of an antigen such as an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule or a fragment thereof. Antibodies are composed of a heavy and a light chain each of which has a variable region termed the variable heavy V region and the variable light V region. Together the Vregion and the Vregion are responsible for binding the antigen recognized by the antibody. In one example an antibody specifically binds to one of the proteins listed in Tables 8 and 9.

This includes intact immunoglobulins and the variants and portions of them well known in the art such as Fab fragments F ab fragments single chain Fv proteins scFv and disulfide stabilized Fv proteins dsFv . A scFv protein is a fusion protein in which a light chain variable region of an immunoglobulin and a heavy chain variable region of an immunoglobulin are bound by a linker while in dsFvs the chains have been mutated to introduce a disulfide bond to stabilize the association of the chains. The term also includes genetically engineered forms such as chimeric antibodies for example humanized murine antibodies heteroconjugate antibodies such as bispecific antibodies . See also 1994 1995 Pierce Chemical Co. Rockford Ill. Kuby 3Ed. W.H. Freeman Co. New York 1997.

Typically a naturally occurring immunoglobulin has heavy H chains and light L chains interconnected by disulfide bonds. There are two types of light chain lambda and kappa. There are five main heavy chain classes or isotypes which determine the functional activity of an antibody molecule IgM IgD IgG IgA and IgE.

Each heavy and light chain contains a constant region and a variable region the regions are also known as domains . In combination the heavy and the light chain variable regions specifically bind the antigen. Light and heavy chain variable regions contain a framework region interrupted by three hypervariable regions also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs . The extent of the framework region and CDRs have been defined see Kabat et al. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1991 which is hereby incorporated by reference . The Kabat database is now maintained online. The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a species. The framework region of an antibody that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains serves to position and align the CDRs in three dimensional space.

The CDRs are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen. The CDRs of each chain are typically referred to as CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 numbered sequentially starting from the N terminus and are also typically identified by the chain in which the particular CDR is located. Thus a VCDR3 is located in the variable domain of the heavy chain of the antibody in which it is found whereas a VCDR1 is the CDR1 from the variable domain of the light chain of the antibody in which it is found. An antibody that binds RET will have a specific Vregion and the Vregion sequence and thus specific CDR sequences. Antibodies with different specificities such as different combining sites for different antigens have different CDRs. Although it is the CDRs that vary from antibody to antibody only a limited number of amino acid positions within the CDRs are directly involved in antigen binding. These positions within the CDRs are called specificity determining residues SDRs .

References to V or VH refer to the variable region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain including that of an Fv scFv dsFv or Fab. References to V or VL refer to the variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain including that of an Fv scFv dsFv or Fab.

A monoclonal antibody is an antibody produced by a single clone of B lymphocytes or by a cell into which the light and heavy chain genes of a single antibody have been transfected. Monoclonal antibodies are produced by methods known to those of skill in the art for instance by making hybrid antibody forming cells from a fusion of myeloma cells with immune spleen cells. Monoclonal antibodies include humanized monoclonal antibodies.

A polyclonal antibody is an antibody that is derived from different B cell lines. Polyclonal antibodies are a mixture of immunoglobulin molecules secreted against a specific antigen each recognizing a different epitope. These antibodies are produced by methods known to those of skill in the art for instance by injection of an antigen into a suitable mammal such as a mouse rabbit or goat that induces the B lymphocytes to produce IgG immunoglobulins specific for the antigen which are then purified from the mammal s serum.

A chimeric antibody has framework residues from one species such as human and CDRs which generally confer antigen binding from another species such as a murine antibody that specifically binds an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule.

A humanized immunoglobulin is an immunoglobulin including a human framework region and one or more CDRs from a non human for example a mouse rat or synthetic immunoglobulin. The non human immunoglobulin providing the CDRs is termed a donor and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is termed an acceptor. In one embodiment all the CDRs are from the donor immunoglobulin in a humanized immunoglobulin. Constant regions need not be present but if they are they must be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions e.g. at least about 85 90 such as about 95 or more identical. Hence all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin except possibly the CDRs are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. Humanized immunoglobulins can be constructed by means of genetic engineering see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 .

An arrangement of molecules such as biological macromolecules such as peptides or nucleic acid molecules or biological samples such as tissue sections in addressable locations on or in a substrate. A microarray is an array that is miniaturized so as to require or be aided by microscopic examination for evaluation or analysis.

The array of molecules features makes it possible to carry out a very large number of analyses on a sample at one time. In certain example arrays one or more molecules such as an oligonucleotide probe will occur on the array a plurality of times such as twice for instance to provide internal controls. The number of addressable locations on the array can vary for example from at least one to at least 2 to at least 5 to at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 50 at least 75 at least 100 at least 150 at least 200 at least 300 at least 500 least 550 at least 600 at least 800 at least 1000 at least 10 000 or more. In particular examples an array includes nucleic acid molecules such as oligonucleotide sequences that are at least 15 nucleotides in length such as about 15 40 nucleotides in length. In particular examples an array includes oligonucleotide probes or primers which can be used to detect sensitive to ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule sequences such as at least one of those listed in Table 1 such as at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 100 at least 150 at least 200 at least 250 at least 300 at least 400 at least 500 at least 600 at least 700 at least 800 at least 900 at least 1000 or at least 1100 sequences listed in Table 1 for example 2 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 120 130 140 150 175 225 275 325 350 375 450 550 650 750 850 950 1050 or 1149 of those listed . In an example the array is a commercially available such as a U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide array from Affymetrix Affymetrix Santa Clara Calif. .

Within an array each arrayed sample is addressable in that its location can be reliably and consistently determined within at least two dimensions of the array. The feature application location on an array can assume different shapes. For example the array can be regular such as arranged in uniform rows and columns or irregular. Thus in ordered arrays the location of each sample is assigned to the sample at the time when it is applied to the array and a key may be provided in order to correlate each location with the appropriate target or feature position. Often ordered arrays are arranged in a symmetrical grid pattern but samples could be arranged in other patterns such as in radially distributed lines spiral lines or ordered clusters . Addressable arrays usually are computer readable in that a computer can be programmed to correlate a particular address on the array with information about the sample at that position such as hybridization or binding data including for instance signal intensity . In some examples of computer readable formats the individual features in the array are arranged regularly for instance in a Cartesian grid pattern which can be correlated to address information by a computer.

Protein based arrays include probe molecules that are or include proteins or where the target molecules are or include proteins and arrays including nucleic acids to which proteins are bound or vice versa. In some examples an array contains antibodies to ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated proteins such as any combination of those listed in Table 1 such as at least 2 least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 100 at least 150 at least 200 at least 250 at least 300 at least 400 at least 500 at least 600 at least 700 at least 800 at least 900 at least 1000 or at least 1100 sequences listed in Table 1 for example 2 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 120 130 140 150 175 225 275 325 350 375 450 550 650 750 850 950 1050 or 1149 of those listed .

An association between two substances or molecules such as the hybridization of one nucleic acid molecule to another or itself the association of an antibody with a peptide or the association of a protein with another protein or nucleic acid molecule. An oligonucleotide molecule binds or stably binds to a target nucleic acid molecule if a sufficient amount of the oligonucleotide molecule forms base pairs or is hybridized to its target nucleic acid molecule to permit detection of that binding. Preferentially binds indicates that one molecule binds to another with high affinity and binds to heterologous molecules at a low affinity.

Binding can be detected by any procedure known to one skilled in the art such as by physical or functional properties of a target oligonucleotide complex or a protein antibody complex. For example binding can be detected functionally by determining whether binding has an observable effect upon a biosynthetic process such as expression of a gene DNA replication transcription translation and the like.

Physical methods of detecting the binding of complementary strands of nucleic acid molecules include but are not limited to such methods as DNase I or chemical footprinting gel shift and affinity cleavage assays Northern blotting dot blotting and light absorption detection procedures. For example one method involves observing a change in light absorption of a solution containing an oligonucleotide or an analog and a target nucleic acid at 220 to 300 nm as the temperature is slowly increased. If the oligonucleotide or analog has bound to its target there is a sudden increase in absorption at a characteristic temperature as the oligonucleotide or analog and target disassociate from each other or melt. In another example the method involves detecting a signal such as a detectable label present on one or both nucleic acid molecules or antibody or protein as appropriate .

The binding between an oligomer and its target nucleic acid is frequently characterized by the temperature T at which 50 of the oligomer is melted from its target. A higher T means a stronger or more stable complex relative to a complex with a lower T .

An expression describing the beneficial or adverse effects of an agent on living matter. When the agent is a complex chemical mixture this activity is exerted by the substance s active ingredient or pharmacophore but can be modified by the other constituents. Activity is generally dosage dependent and it is not uncommon to have effects ranging from beneficial to adverse for one substance when going from low to high doses. In one example a specific binding agent significantly reduces the biological activity of the one or more ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that is upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells such as those listed in Tables 2 and 4 which reduces or eliminates ovarian cancer such as by reducing or inhibiting angiogenesis. In some examples a specific binding agent significantly increases the biological activity of one or more ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that is downregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells such as those listed in Table 3 .

The pathology of cancer includes all phenomena that compromise the well being of the subject. This includes without limitation abnormal or uncontrollable cell growth metastasis interference with the normal functioning of neighboring cells release of cytokines or other secretory products at abnormal levels suppression or aggravation of inflammatory or immunological response neoplasia premalignancy malignancy invasion of surrounding or distant tissues or organs such as lymph nodes etc. Metastatic disease refers to cancer cells that have left the original tumor site and migrate to other parts of the body for example via the bloodstream or lymph system.

Any chemical agent with therapeutic usefulness in the treatment of diseases characterized by abnormal cell growth. Such diseases include tumors neoplasms and cancer as well as diseases characterized by hyperplastic growth such as psoriasis. In one embodiment a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent of use in treating ovarian cancer such as papillary serous ovarian cancer. In one example a chemotherapeutic agent is a radioactive compound. One of skill in the art can readily identify a chemotherapeutic agent of use see for example Slapak and Kufe Principles of Cancer Therapy Chapter 86 in Harrison s Principles of Internal Medicine 14th edition Perry et al. Chemotherapy Ch. 17 in Abeloff Clinical Oncology 2nd ed. 2000 Churchill Livingstone Inc Baltzer and Berkery. eds Oncology Pocket Guide to Chemotherapy 2nd ed. St. Louis Mosby Year Book 1995 Fischer Knobf and Durivage eds The Cancer Chemotherapy Handbook 4th ed. St. Louis Mosby Year Book 1993 . Chemotherapeutic agents used for treating ovarian cancer include but are not limited to carboplatin cisplatin paclitaxel docetaxel doxorubicin epirubicin topotecan irinotecan gemcitabine iazofurine gemcitabine etoposide vinorelbine tamoxifen valspodar cyclophosphamide methotrexate fluorouracil mitoxantrone and vinorelbine. Combination chemotherapy is the administration of more than one agent such as more than one chemotherapeutic agent to treat cancer.

An extracellular matrix component of the vitreous gel that has been reported to be an anti cell adhesive. In particular examples expression of CSPG2 is increased in ovarian cancer endothelial cells. The term CSPG2 includes any CSPG2 gene cDNA mRNA or protein from any organism and that is CSPG2 and is expressed and in some examples overexpressed in ovarian cancer endothelial cells.

Nucleic acid and protein sequences for CSPG2 are publicly available. For example GenBank Accession Nos. NM004385 and BC096495 disclose CSPG2 nucleic acid sequences and GenBank Accession Nos. AAH50524 NP004376 and AAH96495 disclose CSPG2 protein sequences all of which are incorporated by reference as provided by GenBank on Feb. 14 2007.

In one example CSPG2 includes a full length wild type or native sequence as well as CSPG2 allelic variants that retain the ability to be expressed in ovarian tumor endothelial cells and or modulate ovarian tumor endothelial cells such as increase vascular growth. In certain examples CSPG2 has at least 80 sequence identity for example at least 85 90 95 or 98 sequence identity to GenBank Accession No. AAH50524 NP004376 or AAH96495. In other examples CSPG2 has a sequence that hybridizes to AFFYMETRIX Probe ID No. 204619 s at and 221731 x a and retains CSPG2 activity such as the capability to be expressed in ovarian tumor endothelial cells and or modulate tumor and or vascular growth .

Molecules with complementary nucleic acids form a stable duplex or triplex when the strands bind hybridize to each other by forming Watson Crick Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen base pairs. Stable binding occurs when an oligonucleotide molecule remains detectably bound to a target nucleic acid sequence such as an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule under the required conditions.

Complementarity is the degree to which bases in one nucleic acid strand base pair with the bases in a second nucleic acid strand. Complementarity is conveniently described by percentage that is the proportion of nucleotides that form base pairs between two strands or within a specific region or domain of two strands. For example if 10 nucleotides of a 15 nucleotide oligonucleotide form base pairs with a targeted region of a DNA molecule that oligonucleotide is said to have 66.67 complementarity to the region of DNA targeted.

In the present disclosure sufficient complementarity means that a sufficient number of base pairs exist between an oligonucleotide molecule and a target nucleic acid sequence such as a ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule for example any of the genes listed in Table 1 to achieve detectable binding. When expressed or measured by percentage of base pairs formed the percentage complementarity that fulfills this goal can range from as little as about 50 complementarity to full 100 complementary. In general sufficient complementarity is at least about 50 for example at least about 75 complementarity at least about 90 complementarity at least about 95 complementarity at least about 98 complementarity or even at least about 100 complementarity.

A thorough treatment of the qualitative and quantitative considerations involved in establishing binding conditions that allow one skilled in the art to design appropriate oligonucleotides for use under the desired conditions is provided by Beltz et al. 100 266 285 1983 and by Sambrook et al. ed. 2nd ed. vol. 1 3 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989.

Placement in direct physical association including both a solid and liquid form. Contacting can occur in vitro for example with isolated cells or in vivo by administering to a subject.

To reduce the quality amount or strength of something. In one example a therapy decreases a tumor such as the size of a tumor the growth of a tumor number of tumors the metastasis of a tumor or combinations thereof or one or more symptoms associated with a tumor for example as compared to the response in the absence of the therapy such as a therapy administered to affect tumor size by inhibiting angiogenesis via administration of a binding agent capable of binding to one or more of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated markers listed in Tables 1 through 5 that is involved in promoting angiogenesis such as by inhibiting an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated marker that is upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells or by increasing activity of an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated marker that is downregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells . In a particular example a therapy decreases the size of a tumor the growth of a tumor the number of tumors the metastasis of a tumor or combinations thereof subsequent to the therapy such as a decrease of at least 10 at least 20 at least 50 or even at least 90 . Such decreases can be measured using the methods disclosed herein.

The process of identifying a disease by its signs symptoms and results of various tests. The conclusion reached through that process is also called a diagnosis. Forms of testing commonly performed include blood tests medical imaging urinalysis and biopsy.

A long chain polymer which includes the genetic material of most living organisms some viruses have genes including ribonucleic acid RNA . The repeating units in DNA polymers are four different nucleotides each of which includes one of the four bases adenine guanine cytosine and thymine bound to a deoxyribose sugar to which a phosphate group is attached. Triplets of nucleotides referred to as codons in DNA molecules code for amino acid in a polypeptide. The term codon is also used for the corresponding and complementary sequences of three nucleotides in the mRNA into which the DNA sequence is transcribed.

A difference such as an increase or decrease in the conversion of the information encoded in a gene such as an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule into messenger RNA the conversion of mRNA to a protein or both. In some examples the difference is relative to a control or reference value such as an amount of gene expression that is expected in a subject who does not have ovarian cancer or in a normal non cancerous endothelial cell sample. Detecting differential expression can include measuring a change in gene expression.

When used in reference to the expression of a nucleic acid molecule such as a gene refers to any process which results in a decrease in production of a gene product. A gene product can be RNA such as mRNA rRNA tRNA and structural RNA or protein. Therefore gene downregulation or deactivation includes processes that decrease transcription of a gene or translation of mRNA. Examples of genes whose expression is downregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells can be found in Table 1 indicated by a negative fold change such as TLOC1 and HS6ST2 and Table 3 such as PLN SELE GREB1 OGN and LCXD3 .

Examples of processes that decrease transcription include those that facilitate degradation of a transcription initiation complex those that decrease transcription initiation rate those that decrease transcription elongation rate those that decrease processivity of transcription and those that increase transcriptional repression. Gene downregulation can include reduction of expression above an existing level. Examples of processes that decrease translation include those that decrease translational initiation those that decrease translational elongation and those that decrease mRNA stability.

Gene downregulation includes any detectable decrease in the production of a gene product. In certain examples production of a gene product decreases by at least 2 fold for example at least 3 fold or at least 4 fold as compared to a control such an amount of gene expression in a normal endothelial cell . In one example a control is a relative amount of gene expression or protein expression in a biological sample taken from a subject who does not have ovarian cancer.

A member of the epidermal growth factor EGF repeat superfamily of genes known to encode proteins that govern cellular proliferative responses. EGFL6 has been identified as a possible regulator of cell cycle and oncogenesis.

In particular examples expression of EGFL6 is increased in ovarian cancer endothelial cells. The term EGFL6 includes any EGFL6 gene cDNA mRNA or protein from any organism and that is EGFL6 and is expressed and in some examples overexpressed in ovarian cancer endothelial cells.

Nucleic acid and protein sequences for EGFL6 are publicly available. For example GenBank Accession Nos. NM015507 NM019397 and BC038587 disclose EGFL6 nucleic acid sequences and GenBank Accession Nos. AAQ88699 CAM23572 and AAF27812 disclose EGFL6 protein sequences all of which are incorporated by reference as provided by GenBank on Feb. 14 2007.

In one example EGFL6 includes a full length wild type or native sequence as well as EGFL6 allelic variants that retain the ability to be expressed in ovarian tumor endothelial cells and or modulate ovarian tumor endothelial cells such as increase vascular growth. In certain examples EGFL6 has at least 80 sequence identity for example at least 85 90 95 or 98 sequence identity to GenBank Accession No. AAQ88699 CAM23572 or AAF27812. In other examples EGFL6 has a sequence that hybridizes to Affymetrix Probe ID No. 219454 at and retains EGFL6 activity such as the capability to be expressed in ovarian tumor endothelial cells and or modulate tumor and or vascular growth .

The process by which the coded information of a gene is converted into an operational non operational or structural part of a cell such as the synthesis of a protein. Gene expression can be influenced by external signals. For instance exposure of a cell to a hormone may stimulate expression of a hormone induced gene. Different types of cells can respond differently to an identical signal. Expression of a gene also can be regulated anywhere in the pathway from DNA to RNA to protein. Regulation can include controls on transcription translation RNA transport and processing degradation of intermediary molecules such as mRNA or through activation inactivation compartmentalization or degradation of specific protein molecules after they are produced.

The expression of a nucleic acid molecule can be altered relative to a normal wild type nucleic acid molecule. Alterations in gene expression such as differential expression include but are not limited to 1 overexpression 2 underexpression or 3 suppression of expression. Alternations in the expression of a nucleic acid molecule can be associated with and in fact cause a change in expression of the corresponding protein. Specific examples of ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that are up regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells are provided in Tables 2 and 4. Specific examples of ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that are down regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells are listed in Table 3. For example EZH2 EGFL6 TNFAIP6 TWIST1 STC1 HOP CSPG2 and PLXDC1 are upregulated or increased in expression in ovarian tumor endothelial cells while TLOC1 and HS6ST2 are downregulated or decreased in expression in such cells.

Protein expression can also be altered in some manner to be different from the expression of the protein in a normal wild type situation. This includes but is not necessarily limited to 1 a mutation in the protein such that one or more of the amino acid residues is different 2 a short deletion or addition of one or a few such as no more than 10 20 amino acid residues to the sequence of the protein 3 a longer deletion or addition of amino acid residues such as at least 20 residues such that an entire protein domain or sub domain is removed or added 4 expression of an increased amount of the protein compared to a control or standard amount 5 expression of a decreased amount of the protein compared to a control or standard amount 6 alteration of the subcellular localization or targeting of the protein 7 alteration of the temporally regulated expression of the protein such that the protein is expressed when it normally would not be or alternatively is not expressed when it normally would be 8 alteration in stability of a protein through increased longevity in the time that the protein remains localized in a cell and 9 alteration of the localized such as organ or tissue specific or subcellular localization expression of the protein such that the protein is not expressed where it would normally be expressed or is expressed where it normally would not be expressed each compared to a control or standard.

Controls or standards for comparison to a sample for the determination of differential expression include samples believed to be normal in that they are not altered for the desired characteristic for example a sample from a subject who does not have cancer such as ovarian cancer as well as laboratory values even though possibly arbitrarily set keeping in mind that such values can vary from laboratory to laboratory.

Laboratory standards and values may be set based on a known or determined population value and can be supplied in the format of a graph or table that permits comparison of measured experimentally determined values.

Differential or altered gene expression can be detected by changes in the detectable amount of gene expression such as cDNA or mRNA or by changes in the detectable amount of proteins expressed by those genes. A distinct or identifiable pattern of gene expression for instance a pattern of high and low expression of a defined set of genes or gene indicative nucleic acids such as ESTs in some examples as few as one or two genes provides a profile but more genes can be used in a profile for example at least 3 at least 4 at least 5 at least 6 at least 10 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 50 at least 80 at least 100 at least 190 at least 200 at least 300 at least 400 at least 500 at least 550 at least 600 at least 700 at least 800 at least 900 at least 1000 at least 1100 or more of those listed in any of Tables 1 5. A gene expression profile also referred to as a fingerprint can be linked to a tissue or cell type such as ovarian cancer cell to a particular stage of normal tissue growth or disease progression such as advanced ovarian cancer or to any other distinct or identifiable condition that influences gene expression in a predictable way. Gene expression profiles can include relative as well as absolute expression levels of specific genes and can be viewed in the context of a test sample compared to a baseline or control sample profile such as a sample from a subject who does not have ovarian cancer or normal endothelial cells . In one example a gene expression profile in a subject is read on an array such as a nucleic acid or protein array . For example a gene expression profile is performed using a commercially available array such as a Human Genome U133 2.0 Plus Microarray from AFFYMETRIX AFFYMETRIX Santa Clara Calif. .

In particular examples expression of HOP is increased in ovarian cancer endothelial cells. The term HOP includes any HOP gene cDNA mRNA or protein from any organism and that is HOP and is expressed and in some examples overexpressed in ovarian cancer endothelial cells.

Nucleic acid and protein sequences for HOP are publicly available. For example GenBank Accession Nos. NM139211 XM001083738 and XM001137349 disclose HOP nucleic acid sequences and GenBank Accession Nos. AAH14225 NP631958 and NP631957 disclose HOP protein sequences all of which are incorporated by reference as provided by GenBank on Feb. 14 2007.

In one example HOP includes a full length wild type or native sequence as well as HOP allelic variants that retain the ability to be expressed in ovarian tumor endothelial cells and or modulate ovarian tumor endothelial cells such as increase vascular growth. In certain examples HOP has at least 80 sequence identity for example at least 85 90 95 or 98 sequence identity to GenBank Accession No. AAH14225 NP631958 or NP631957. In other examples HOP has a sequence that hybridizes to AFFYMETRIX Probe ID No. 211597 s at and retains HOP activity such as the capability to be expressed in ovarian tumor endothelial cells and or modulate tumor and or vascular growth .

To form base pairs between complementary regions of two strands of DNA RNA or between DNA and RNA thereby forming a duplex molecule. Hybridization conditions resulting in particular degrees of stringency will vary depending upon the nature of the hybridization method and the composition and length of the hybridizing nucleic acid sequences. Generally the temperature of hybridization and the ionic strength such as the Na concentration of the hybridization buffer will determine the stringency of hybridization. Calculations regarding hybridization conditions for attaining particular degrees of stringency are discussed in Sambrook et al. 1989 Molecular Cloning second edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Plainview N.Y. chapters 9 and 11 . The following is an exemplary set of hybridization conditions and is not limiting 

Any chemical compound nucleic acid molecule peptide or polypeptide such as an antibody or RNAi that can reduce activity of a gene product or interfere with expression of a gene respectively. In some examples an inhibitor can reduce or inhibit the activity of a protein that is encoded by a gene either directly or indirectly. Direct inhibition can be accomplished for example by binding to a protein and thereby preventing the protein from binding an intended target such as a receptor. Indirect inhibition can be accomplished for example by binding to a protein s intended target such as a receptor or binding partner thereby blocking or reducing activity of the protein. In some examples an inhibitor of the disclosure can inhibit a gene by reducing or inhibiting expression of the gene inter alia by interfering with gene expression transcription processing translation post translational modification for example by interfering with the gene s mRNA and blocking translation of the gene product or by post translational modification of a gene product or by causing changes in intracellular localization.

An isolated biological component such as a nucleic acid molecule protein or cell has been substantially separated or purified away from other biological components in the cell of the organism or the organism itself in which the component naturally occurs such as other chromosomal and extra chromosomal DNA and RNA proteins and cells. Nucleic acid molecules and proteins that have been isolated include nucleic acid molecules and proteins purified by standard purification methods. The term also embraces nucleic acid molecules and proteins prepared by recombinant expression in a host cell as well as chemically synthesized nucleic acid molecules and proteins. For example an isolated serous papillary ovarian cancer cell is one that is substantially separated from other ovarian cell subtypes such as endometrioid clear cell or mucinous subtypes.

An agent capable of detection for example by ELISA spectrophotometry flow cytometry or microscopy. For example a label can be attached to a nucleic acid molecule or protein thereby permitting detection of the nucleic acid molecule or protein. Examples of labels include but are not limited to radioactive isotopes enzyme substrates co factors ligands chemiluminescent agents fluorophores haptens enzymes and combinations thereof. Methods for labeling and guidance in the choice of labels appropriate for various purposes are discussed for example in Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 and Ausubel et al. In Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons New York 1998 . In a particular example a label is conjugated to a binding agent that specifically binds to one or more of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules disclosed in Tables 1 through 5 to allow for the detection screening for angiogenesis and or the presence of a tumor in a subject.

This term includes both human and non human mammals. Examples of mammals include but are not limited to humans and veterinary and laboratory animals such as pigs cows goats cats dogs rabbits and mice.

Such molecules can include at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 or at least 50 consecutive nucleotides of these sequences or more and can be obtained from any region of a ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule.

A plurality of joined nucleotides joined by native phosphodiester bonds between about 6 and about 300 nucleotides in length. An oligonucleotide analog refers to moieties that function similarly to oligonucleotides but have non naturally occurring portions. For example oligonucleotide analogs can contain non naturally occurring portions such as altered sugar moieties or inter sugar linkages such as a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide.

Particular oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide analogs can include linear sequences up to about 200 nucleotides in length for example a sequence such as DNA or RNA that is at least 6 nucleotides for example at least 8 at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 21 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 100 or even at least 200 nucleotides long or from about 6 to about 50 nucleotides for example about 10 25 nucleotides such as 12 15 or 20 nucleotides.

Cancer of the ovaries includes ovarian carcinoma papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma mucinous cystadenocarcinoma endometrioid tumors celioblastoma clear cell carcinoma unclassified carcinoma granulosa thecal cell tumors Sertoli Leydig cell tumors dysgerminoma and malignant teratoma. The most common type of ovarian cancer is papillary serous carcinoma.

Surgery is an exemplary treatment for ovarian cancer and can be necessary for diagnosis. The type of surgery depends upon how widespread the cancer is when diagnosed the cancer stage as well as the type and grade of cancer. The surgeon may remove one unilateral oophorectomy or both ovaries bilateral oophorectomy the fallopian tubes salpingectomy and the uterus hysterectomy . For some very early tumors stage 1 low grade or low risk disease only the involved ovary and fallopian tube will be removed called a unilateral salpingo oophorectomy USO especially in young females who wish to preserve their fertility. In advanced disease as much tumor as possible is removed debulking surgery . In cases where this type of surgery is successful the prognosis is improved compared to subjects where large tumor masses more than 1 cm in diameter are left behind.

Chemotherapy is often used after surgery to treat any residual disease. At present systemic chemotherapy often includes a platinum derivative with a taxane as a method of treating advanced ovarian cancer. Chemotherapy is also used to treat subjects who have a recurrence.

A molecule whose expression is altered in ovarian tumor endothelial cells. Such molecules include for instance nucleic acid sequences such as DNA cDNA or mRNAs and proteins. Specific genes include those listed in Tables 1 through 5. Thus the presence of the respective ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules can be used to diagnose or determine the prognosis of an ovarian tumor in a subject.

In an example an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule is any molecule listed in Tables 1 through 5. Specific examples of ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that are up regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells are provided in Tables 2 and 4. Specific examples of ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that are down regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells are listed in Table 3. As illustrated in Table 4 a number of the identified ovarian cell tumor associated molecules are related to cell proliferation tube formation and cell motility.

Ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules can be involved in or influenced by cancer in different ways including causative in that a change in a ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule leads to development of or progression of ovarian cancer or resultive in that development of or progression of ovarian cancer causes or results in a change in the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule .

The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers vehicles useful in this disclosure are conventional. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. 15th Edition 1975 describes compositions and formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of one or more therapeutic agents such as one or more compositions that include a binding agent that specifically binds to at least one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules.

In general the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. For instance parenteral formulations can include injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water physiological saline balanced salt solutions aqueous dextrose glycerol or the like as a vehicle. In addition to biologically neutral carriers pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of non toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents preservatives and pH buffering agents and the like for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate sodium lactate potassium chloride calcium chloride and triethanolamine oleate.

A large transmembrane receptor. In vitro plexin C1 has been shown to bind the GPI anchored semaphorin Sema7A and the soluble viral semaphorins SemaVA A39R and SemaVB AHV . Plexin C1 engagement by SemaVA inhibits integrin mediated dendritic cell adhesion and chemotaxis in vitro suggesting a role for plexin C1 in dendritic cell migration.

In an example expression of PLXDL1 is increased in ovarian tumor endothelial cells. The term PLXDC1 includes any plexin C1 gene cDNA mRNA or protein from any organism and that is a PLXDC1 and is expressed and in some examples overexpressed in ovarian tumor endothelial cells.

Exemplary nucleic acid and protein sequences for PLXDC1 are publicly available. For example GenBank Accession Nos. NM018797 XM622776 AB208934 and NM005761 disclose PLXDC1 nucleic acid sequences and GenBank Accession Nos. NP061267 XP622776 BAD92171 and NP005752 disclose PLXDC1 protein sequences all of which are incorporated by reference as provided by GenBank on Feb. 14 2007.

In one example a PLXDC1 sequence includes a full length wild type or native sequence as well as PLXDC1 allelic variants fragments homologs or fusion sequences that retain the ability to be expressed in ovarian tumor endothelial cells and or modulate ovarian tumor endothelial cells such as increase vascular growth. In certain examples PLXDC1 has at least 80 sequence identity for example at least 85 90 95 or 98 sequence identity to GenBank Accession No. NP061267 XP622776 BAD92171 or NP005752. In other examples a PLXDC1 has a sequence that hybridizes to AFFYMETRIX Probe ID No. 214081 at and retains PLXDC1 activity such as the capability to be expressed in ovarian tumor endothelial cells and or modulate tumor and or vascular growth .

An in vitro amplification technique that increases the number of copies of a nucleic acid molecule for example a nucleic acid molecule in a sample or specimen . In an example a biological sample collected from a subject e.g. with ovarian cancer is contacted with a pair of oligonucleotide primers under conditions that allow for the hybridization of the primers to nucleic acid template in the sample. The primers are extended under suitable conditions dissociated from the template and then re annealed extended and dissociated to amplify the number of copies of the nucleic acid. The product of a PCR can be characterized by methods known in the art such as electrophoresis restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns oligonucleotide hybridization or ligation and or nucleic acid sequencing using standard techniques.

Short nucleic acid molecules for instance DNA oligonucleotides 10 100 nucleotides in length such as about 15 20 25 30 or 50 nucleotides or more in length. Primers can be annealed to a complementary target DNA strand such as a gene listed in Table 1 by nucleic acid hybridization to form a hybrid between the primer and the target DNA strand. Primer pairs can be used for amplification of a nucleic acid sequence such as by PCR or other nucleic acid amplification methods known in the art.

Methods for preparing and using nucleic acid primers are described for example in Sambrook et al. In CSHL New York 1989 Ausubel et al. ed. In John Wiley Sons New York 1998 and Innis et al. Academic Press Inc. San Diego Calif. 1990 . PCR primer pairs can be derived from a known sequence for example by using computer programs intended for that purpose such as Primer Version 0.5 1991 Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research Cambridge Mass. . One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the specificity of a particular primer increases with its length. Thus for example a primer including 30 consecutive nucleotides of an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule will anneal to a target sequence such as another homolog of the designated endothelial cell tumor associated protein with a higher specificity than a corresponding primer of only 15 nucleotides. Thus in order to obtain greater specificity primers can be selected that include at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 or more consecutive nucleotides of an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated nucleotide sequence.

A prediction of the course of a disease such as ovarian cancer. The prediction can include determining the likelihood of a subject to develop aggressive recurrent disease to survive a particular amount of time e.g. determine the likelihood that a subject will survive 1 2 3 or 5 years to respond to a particular therapy e.g. chemotherapy or combinations thereof.

The term purified does not require absolute purity rather it is intended as a relative term. Thus for example a purified protein preparation is one in which the protein referred to is more pure than the protein in its natural environment within a cell. For example a preparation of a protein is purified such that the protein represents at least 50 of the total protein content of the preparation. Similarly a purified oligonucleotide preparation is one in which the oligonucleotide is more pure than in an environment including a complex mixture of oligonucleotides.

A recombinant nucleic acid molecule is one that has a sequence that is not naturally occurring or has a sequence that is made by an artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of sequence. This artificial combination can be accomplished for example by chemical synthesis or by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acid molecules such as by genetic engineering techniques.

A biological specimen containing genomic DNA RNA including mRNA protein or combinations thereof obtained from a subject. Examples include but are not limited to peripheral blood urine saliva tissue biopsy surgical specimen amniocentesis samples and autopsy material. In one example a sample includes an ovarian cancer tissue biopsy.

A measurement of activity such as biological activity of a molecule or a collection of molecules in a given condition. In an example sensitivity refers to the activity of an agent such as a binding agent that preferentially binds to one or more ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules to alter the growth development or progression of a disease such as ovarian cancer. In certain examples sensitivity or responsiveness can be assessed using any endpoint indicating a benefit to the subject including without limitation 1 inhibition to some extent of tumor growth including slowing down and complete growth arrest 2 reduction in the number of tumor cells 3 reduction in tumor size 4 inhibition such as reduction slowing down or complete stopping of tumor cell infiltration into adjacent peripheral organs and or tissues 5 inhibition such as reduction slowing down or complete stopping of metastasis 6 enhancement of anti tumor immune response which may but does not have to result in the regression or rejection of the tumor 7 relief to some extent of one or more symptoms associated with the tumor 8 increase in the length of survival following treatment 9 decreased mortality at a given point of time following treatment and or 10 reducing or inhibiting angiogenesis.

The identity similarity between two or more nucleic acid sequences or two or more amino acid sequences is expressed in terms of the identity or similarity between the sequences. Sequence identity can be measured in terms of percentage identity the higher the percentage the more identical the sequences are. Sequence similarity can be measured in terms of percentage similarity which takes into account conservative amino acid substitutions the higher the percentage the more similar the sequences are. Homologs or orthologs of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences possess a relatively high degree of sequence identity similarity when aligned using standard methods. This homology is more significant when the orthologous proteins or cDNAs are derived from species which are more closely related such as human and mouse sequences compared to species more distantly related such as human and sequences .

Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Various programs and alignment algorithms are described in Smith Waterman 2 482 1981 Needleman Wunsch 48 443 1970 Pearson Lipman 85 2444 1988 Higgins Sharp 73 237 44 1988 Higgins Sharp 5 151 3 1989 Corpet et al. 16 10881 90 1988 Huang et al. 8 155 65 1992 and Pearson et al. 24 307 31 1994. Altschul et al. 215 403 10 1990 presents a detailed consideration of sequence alignment methods and homology calculations.

The NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST Altschul et al. 215 403 10 1990 is available from several sources including the National Center for Biological Information NCBI National Library of Medicine Building 38A Room 8N805 Bethesda Md. 20894 and on the Internet for use in connection with the sequence analysis programs blastp blastn blastx tblastn and tblastx. Additional information can be found at the NCBI web site.

BLASTN is used to compare nucleic acid sequences while BLASTP is used to compare amino acid sequences. If the two compared sequences share homology then the designated output file will present those regions of homology as aligned sequences. If the two compared sequences do not share homology then the designated output file will not present aligned sequences.

Once aligned the number of matches is determined by counting the number of positions where an identical nucleotide or amino acid residue is presented in both sequences. The percent sequence identity is determined by dividing the number of matches either by the length of the sequence set forth in the identified sequence or by an articulated length such as 100 consecutive nucleotides or amino acid residues from a sequence set forth in an identified sequence followed by multiplying the resulting value by 100. For example a nucleic acid sequence that has 1166 matches when aligned with a test sequence having 1154 nucleotides is 75.0 percent identical to the test sequence 1166 1554 100 75.0 . The percent sequence identity value is rounded to the nearest tenth. For example 75.11 75.12 75.13 and 75.14 are rounded down to 75.1 while 75.15 75.16 75.17 75.18 and 75.19 are rounded up to 75.2. The length value will always be an integer. In another example a target sequence containing a 20 nucleotide region that aligns with 20 consecutive nucleotides from an identified sequence as follows contains a region that shares 75 percent sequence identity to that identified sequence that is 15 20 100 75 .

For comparisons of amino acid sequences of greater than about 30 amino acids the Blast 2 sequences function is employed using the default BLOSUM62 matrix set to default parameters gap existence cost of 11 and a per residue gap cost of 1 . Homologs are typically characterized by possession of at least 70 sequence identity counted over the full length alignment with an amino acid sequence using the NCBI Basic Blast 2.0 gapped blastp with databases such as the nr or swissprot database. Queries searched with the blastn program are filtered with DUST Hancock and Armstrong 199410 67 70 . Other programs use SEG. In addition a manual alignment can be performed. Proteins with even greater similarity will show increasing percentage identities when assessed by this method such as at least about 75 80 85 90 95 98 or 99 sequence identity with the proteins listed in Table 1.

When aligning short peptides fewer than around 30 amino acids the alignment is be performed using the Blast 2 sequences function employing the PAM30 matrix set to default parameters open gap 9 extension gap 1 penalties . Proteins with even greater similarity to the reference sequence will show increasing percentage identities when assessed by this method such as at least about 60 70 75 80 85 90 95 98 99 sequence identity with the proteins listed in Table 1. When less than the entire sequence is being compared for sequence identity homologs will typically possess at least 75 sequence identity over short windows of 10 20 amino acids and can possess sequence identities of at least 85 90 95 or 98 depending on their identity to the reference sequence. Methods for determining sequence identity over such short windows are described at the NCBI web site.

One indication that two nucleic acid molecules are closely related is that the two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions as described above. Nucleic acid sequences that do not show a high degree of identity may nevertheless encode identical or similar conserved amino acid sequences due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Changes in a nucleic acid sequence can be made using this degeneracy to produce multiple nucleic acid molecules that all encode substantially the same protein. Such homologous nucleic acid sequences can for example possess at least about 60 70 80 90 95 98 or 99 sequence identity with the genes listed in Table 1 as determined by this method. An alternative and not necessarily cumulative indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the polypeptide which the first nucleic acid encodes is immunologically cross reactive with the polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic acid.

One of skill in the art will appreciate that the particular sequence identity ranges are provided for guidance only it is possible that strongly significant homologs could be obtained that fall outside the ranges provided.

It is shown herein that ovarian cancer is associated with differential expression of ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. For example the disclosed gene expression profile has identified ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. Based on these observations methods of treatment to reduce or eliminate ovarian cancer are disclosed. For example the method can include inhibiting the expression or biological activity of at least one of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules from Tables 1 2 4 and or 5 that are upregulated in ovarian tumor cells or increasing the expression or biological activity of at least one of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules from Tables 1 3 and or 5 that are downregulated in ovarian tumor cells or combinations thereof. As used herein inhibit does not require 100 inhibition of expression or activity. For example a substantial reduction may be adequate such as reduction in expression or activity of at least 20 at least 30 at least 50 at least 75 or at least 95 may be sufficient to obtain desired therapeutic results. In some examples an increase in expression or activity is an increase of at least 20 at least 30 at least 50 at least 75 or at least 95 . In some embodiments the subject is a human but the subject can alternatively be a veterinary or laboratory subject. In some embodiments the ovarian cancer is papillary serous ovarian cancer.

Methods are disclosed herein for treating an ovarian tumor such as ovarian cancer. In one example the method includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of a composition to a subject. The composition can include a binding agent that is specific for one of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in any of Tables 1 2 4 or 5 that are upregulated in ovarian tumor cells. Administration of such compounds decreases the expression or activity of the molecule that is undesirably upregulated in ovarian cancer cells. The molecules in Tables 1 2 4 or 5 include for instance nucleic acid sequences such as DNA cDNA or mRNAs and proteins. Specific genes include those listed in Tables 1 2 4 or 5 as well as fragments of the full length genes cDNAs or mRNAs and proteins encoded thereby whose expression is upregulated in response to an ovarian tumor such as ovarian cancer.

In particular examples the specific binding agent is an inhibitor such as a siRNA or an antibody to one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that is upregulated in ovarian tumor cells. For example the specific binding agent can be a siRNA that interferes with mRNA expression of one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that are involved in angiogenesis such as a molecule involved in regulating cell motility cell proliferation or tube formation thereby inhibiting cell motility cell proliferation or tube formation. For example the specific binding agent can be a siRNA that inhibits the expression of PTK2 EZH2 or Jagged1.

Treating Ovarian Cancer by Altering Activity of an Ovarian Endothelial Cell Tumor Associated Molecule

Methods are provided to inhibit ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule activity or expression to treat an ovarian tumor. Treatment of tumors by reducing the number of ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules can include delaying the development of the tumor in a subject such as preventing metastasis of a tumor . Treatment of a tumor also includes reducing signs or symptoms associated with the presence of such a tumor for example by reducing the size growth or volume of the tumor or a metastasis thereof . Such reduced growth can in some examples decrease or slow metastasis of the tumor or reduce the size or volume of the tumor by at least 10 at least 20 at least 50 or at least 75 such as by inhibiting angiogenesis by at least 10 at least 20 at least 50 or at least 75 . For example ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules involved in angiogenesis such as molecules involved in promoting cell proliferation cell motility or tube formation can be inhibited to treat an ovarian tumor such as those provided in any of Tables 1 2 4 or 5 that are upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells. In other examples ovarian tumor growth is reduced or inhibited by inhibiting the expression or biological activity ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules provided in any of Tables 1 2 4 or 5 that are upregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells. In further examples inhibition of ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules includes reducing the invasive activity of the tumor in the subject. In some examples treatment using the methods disclosed herein prolongs the time of survival of the subject.

Specific binding agents are agents that selectively bind with higher affinity to a molecule of interest than to other molecules. For example a specific binding agent can be one that binds with high affinity to one of the genes or gene products of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in any of Tables 1 2 4 or 5 that are upregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells but does not substantially bind to another gene or gene product. In a specific example a specific binding agent binds to one gene listed in Tables 1 2 4 or 5 that is upregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells thereby reducing or inhibiting expression of the gene but does not bind to the other genes or gene product listed in such Tables under similar conditions. For example the agent can interfere with gene expression transcription processing translation post translational modification such as by interfering with the gene s mRNA and blocking translation of the gene product or by post translational modification of a gene product or by causing changes in intracellular localization. In another specific example a specific binding agent binds to a protein encoded by of one of the genes listed in Table 1 2 4 or 5 that is upregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells with a binding affinity in the range of 0.1 to 20 nM and reduces or inhibits the activity of such protein.

Examples of specific binding agents include but are not limited to siRNAs antibodies ligands recombinant proteins peptide mimetics and soluble receptor fragments. One example of a specific binding agent is a siRNA. Methods of making siRNA that can be used clinically are known in the art. Particular siRNAs and methods that can be used to produce and administer them are described in detail below. In some examples the siRNA is incorporated into a chitosan CH nanoparticle such as chitosan obtained from shellfish or fungi.

Another specific example of a specific binding agent is an antibody such as a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. Methods of making antibodies that can be used clinically are known in the art. Particular antibodies and methods that can be used to produce them are described in detail below.

In a further example small molecular weight inhibitors or antagonists of the receptor protein can be used to regulate activity such as the expression or production of ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. In a particular example small molecular weight inhibitors or antagonists of the proteins encoded by the genes listed in Tables 2 and or 4 are employed.

Specific binding agents can be therapeutic for example by reducing or inhibiting the biological activity of a nucleic acid or protein. Complete inhibition is not required. For example a reduction by at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 50 at least 70 or even at least 90 can be sufficient. For example a specific binding agent that binds with high affinity to a gene listed in Tables 1 2 4 and or 5 that are upregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells may substantially reduce the biological function of the gene or gene product for example the ability of the gene or gene product to facilitate angiogenesis . In other examples a specific binding agent that binds with high affinity to one of the proteins encoded by the genes listed in Tables 1 2 4 and or 5 that are upregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells may substantially reduce the biological function of the protein for example the ability of the protein to promote angiogenesis . Such agents can be administered in therapeutically effective amounts to subjects in need thereof such as a subject having ovarian cancer such as papillary serous ovarian cancer.

In some examples subjects are initially screened to determine if they have ovarian cancer. In an example subjects are initially screened for ovarian cancer by using one of the disclosed gene expression profiles as discussed in detail below . In some examples if one or more of the disclosed endothelial cell tumor associated molecules upregulated in ovarian endothelial cells such as those listed in Tables 2 and 4 is detected a specific binding agent capable of reducing or inhibiting ovarian cancer is adminstered.

In some examples specific binding agents are initially screened for treating ovarian cancer by use of the disclosed gene expression profile see below . For example the disclosed gene expression profile can be used to identify specific binding agents capable of reducing or inhibiting ovarian cancer. In an example the disclosed gene expression profile is used to identify compositions that can be employed to reduce or inhibit angiogenesis in ovarian tumors.

A tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue that results from excessive cell division. A particular example of a tumor is cancer. For example the current application provides methods for the treatment such as the prevention or reduction of metastasis of tumors such as cancers by altering the expression production of one or more disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. In some examples the tumor is treated in vivo for example in a mammalian subject such as a human subject. Exemplary tumors that can be treated using the disclosed methods include but are not limited to ovarian cancer including metastases of such tumors to other organs. Generally the tumor is an ovarian cancer such as papillary serous ovarian cancer.

Methods of administrating the disclosed compositions are routine and can be determined by a skilled clinician. For example the disclosed therapies such as those that include a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Tables 1 2 4 or 5 whose expression is increased in ovarian endothelial tumor associated cells can be administered via injection intratumorally orally topically transdermally parenterally or via inhalation or spray. In a particular example a composition is administered intravenously to a mammalian subject such as a human.

The therapeutically effective amount of the agents administered can vary depending upon the desired effects and the subject to be treated. In one example the method includes daily administration of at least 1 g of the composition to the subject such as a human subject . For example a human can be administered at least 1 g or at least 1 mg of the composition daily such as 10 g to 100 g daily 100 g to 1000 g daily for example 10 g daily 100 g daily or 1000 g daily. In one example the subject is administered at least 1 g such as 1 100 g intravenously of the composition including a binding agent that specifically binds to one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules provided herein. In one example the subject is administered at least 1 mg intramuscularly for example in an extremity of such composition. In a specific example the dose is 50 to 350 g kg twice weekly such as 150 g kg twice weekly for example via iv injection . The dosage can be administered in divided doses such as 2 3 or 4 divided doses per day or in a single dosage daily.

In particular examples the subject is administered the therapeutic composition that includes a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules on a multiple daily dosing schedule such as at least two consecutive days 10 consecutive days and so forth for example for a period of weeks months or years. In one example the subject is administered the therapeutic composition that a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules daily for a period of at least 30 days such as at least 2 months at least 4 months at least 6 months at least 12 months at least 24 months or at least 36 months.

The therapeutic compositions such as those that include a binding agent specific for one of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules can further include one or more biologically active or inactive compounds or both such as anti neoplastic agents and conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers respectively.

In a particular example a therapeutic composition that includes a therapeutically effective amount of a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules further includes one or more biologically inactive compounds. Examples of such biologically inactive compounds include but are not limited to carriers thickeners diluents buffers preservatives and carriers. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers useful for these formulations are conventional see Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. 19th Edition 1995 . For solid compositions for example powder pill tablet or capsule forms conventional non toxic solid carriers can include for example pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch or magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically neutral carriers pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can include minor amounts of non toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents preservatives and pH buffering agents and the like for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.

In particular examples prior to during or following administration of a therapeutic amount of an agent that reduces or inhibits ovarian cancer due to the interaction of a binding agent with one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules the subject can receive one or more other therapies. In one example the subject receives one or more treatments to remove or reduce the tumor prior to administration of a therapeutic amount of a composition including a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules.

Examples of such therapies include but are not limited to surgical treatment for removal or reduction of the tumor such as surgical resection cryotherapy or chemoembolization as well as anti tumor pharmaceutical treatments which can include radiotherapeutic agents anti neoplastic chemotherapeutic agents antibiotics alkylating agents and antioxidants kinase inhibitors and other agents. Particular examples of additional therapeutic agents that can be used include microtubule binding agents DNA intercalators or cross linkers DNA synthesis inhibitors DNA and or RNA transcription inhibitors antibodies enzymes enzyme inhibitors and gene regulators. These agents which are administered at a therapeutically effective amount and treatments can be used alone or in combination. Methods and therapeutic dosages of such agents are known to those skilled in the art and can be determined by a skilled clinician.

 Microtubule binding agent refers to an agent that interacts with tubulin to stabilize or destabilize microtubule formation thereby inhibiting cell division. Examples of microtubule binding agents that can be used in conjunction with the disclosed therapy include without limitation paclitaxel docetaxel vinblastine vindesine vinorelbine navelbine the epothilones colchicine dolastatin 15 nocodazole podophyllotoxin and rhizoxin. Analogs and derivatives of such compounds also can be used and are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example suitable epothilones and epothilone analogs are described in International Publication No. WO 2004 018478. Taxoids such as paclitaxel and docetaxel as well as the analogs of paclitaxel taught by U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 610 860 5 530 020 and 5 912 264 can be used.

Other therapeutic agents for example anti tumor agents that may or may not fall under one or more of the classifications above also are suitable for administration in combination with the disclosed therapies. By way of example such agents include adriamycin apigenin rapamycin zebularine cimetidine and derivatives and analogs thereof.

In one example the therapeutic composition such as one including a binding agent specific for one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules is injected into the subject in the presence of an adjuvant. An adjuvant is an agent that when used in combination with an immunogenic agent augments or otherwise alters or modifies a resultant immune response. In some examples an adjuvant increases the titer of antibodies induced in a subject by the immunogenic agent. In one example the one or more peptides are administered to the subject as an emulsion with an adjuvant and sterile water for injection for example an intravenous or intramuscular injection . Incomplete Freund s Adjuvant Seppic Inc. can be used as the Freund s Incomplete Adjuvant IFA Fairfield N.J. . In some examples IFA is provided in 3 ml of a mineral oil solution based on mannide oleate Montanide ISA 51 . At the time of injection the peptide s is mixed with the Montanide ISA.51 and then administered to the subject. Other adjuvants can be used for example Freund s complete adjuvant B30 MDP LA 15 PH montanide saponin aluminum hydroxide alum lipids keyhole lympet protein hemocyanin a mycobacterial antigen and combinations thereof.

In some examples the subject receiving the therapeutic peptide composition such as one including a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules is also administered interleukin 2 IL 2 for example via intravenous administration. In particular examples IL 2 Chiron Corp. Emeryville Calif. is administered at a dose of at least 500 000 IU kg as an intravenous bolus over a 15 minute period every eight hours beginning on the day after administration of the peptides and continuing for up to 5 days. Doses can be skipped depending on subject tolerance.

In some examples the disclosed compositions can be co administered with a fully human antibody to cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 anti CTLA 4 . In some example subjects receive at least 1 mg kg anti CTLA 4 such as 3 mg kg every 3 weeks or 3 mg kg as the initial dose with subsequent doses reduced to 1 mg kg every 3 weeks .

In one example at least a portion of the ovarian tumor such as a metastatic tumor is surgically removed for example via cryotherapy irradiated chemically treated for example via chemoembolization or combinations thereof prior to administration of the disclosed therapies such as administration of a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules . For example a subject having a metastatic tumor can have all or part of the tumor surgically excised prior to administration of the disclosed therapies such as one including a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules . In an example one or more chemotherapeutic agents is administered following treatment with a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. In another particular example the subject has a metastatic tumor and is administered radiation therapy chemoembolization therapy or both concurrently with the administration of the disclosed therapies such as one including a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules .

In an example certain inhibitors provided by this disclosure are species of siRNAs. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily generate siRNAs which specifically bind to one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that are upregulated in ovarian endothelial cell tumor cells. In an example commercially available kits such as siRNA molecule synthesizing kits from PROMEGA Madison Wis. or AMBION Austin Tex. may be used to synthesize siRNA molecules. In another example siRNAs are obtained from commercial sources such as from QIAGEN Inc Germantown Md. INVITROGEN Carlsbad Calif. AMBION Austin Tex. DHARMACON Lafayette Colo. or OPENBIOSYSTEMS Huntsville Ala. .

In certain examples expression vectors are employed to express the at least one siRNA molecule. For example an expression vector can include a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one siRNA molecule corresponding to at least one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Tables 1 2 4 and or Table 5 that are upregulated in ovarian endothelial cell tumor cells. For example siRNA specific for EZH2 can be generated using publicly available EZH2 nucleic acid sequences such as those described above. In a particular example the vector contains a sequence s encoding both strands of a siRNA molecule comprising a duplex. In another example the vector also contains sequence s encoding a single nucleic acid molecule that is self complementary and thus forms a siRNA molecule. Non limiting examples of such expression vectors are described in Paul et al. 19 505 2002 Miyagishi and Taira 19 497 2002 Lee et al. 19 500 2002 and Novina et al. online publication Jun. 3 2003.

In other examples siRNA molecules include a delivery vehicle including inter alia liposomes for administration to a subject carriers and diluents and their salts and can be present in pharmaceutical compositions. Nucleic acid molecules can be administered to cells by a variety of methods known to those of skill in the art including but not restricted to encapsulation in liposomes by iontophoresis or by incorporation into other delivery vehicles such as hydrogels cyclodextrins biodegradable nanocapsules and bioadhesive microspheres or by proteinaceous vectors see for example O Hare and Normand International PCT Publication No. WO 00 53722 . In one specific example siRNAs are administered at according to the teachings of Soutschek et al. Nature Vol. 432 173 178 2004 or Karpilow et al. Pharma Genomics 32 40 2004 both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

In some examples siRNAs are incorporated into neutral liposomes such as DOPC or chitosan and injected intraperitoneal or intravenously. For example a siRNA can be administered at least 1 g kg twice weekly such as at least 50 g kg twice weekly at least 100 g kg twice weekly at least 125 g kg twice weekly at least 150 g kg twice weekly at least 200 g kg twice weekly for at least 1 week such as at least 2 weeks at least 3 weeks at least 4 weeks at least 6 weeks at least 12 weeks or at least 24 weeks. In one example about at least 1 500 g kg such 10 250 g kg is adminstered at least twice weekly for at least 1 week such as at least 2 weeks at least 3 weeks at least 4 weeks at least 6 weeks at least 12 weeks or at least 24 weeks. In a certain example approximately 150 g kg is administered twice weekly for 2 to 3 weeks. In other examples approximately 1 ug kg daily for 3 weeks or 50 ug kg every other day for 3 weeks is administered.

Alternatively the nucleic acid vehicle combination can be locally delivered by direct injection or by use of an infusion pump. Direct injection of the nucleic acid molecules of the disclosure whether subcutaneous intramuscular or intradermal can take place using standard needle and syringe methodologies or by needle free technologies such as those described by Barry et al. International PCT Publication No. WO 99 31262. Other delivery routes but are not limited to oral delivery such as in tablet or pill form intrathecal or intraperitoneal delivery. For example intraperitoneal delivery can take place by injecting the treatment into the peritoneal cavity of the subject in order to directly deliver the molecules to the tumor site. More detailed descriptions of nucleic acid delivery and administration are provided in Sullivan et al. PCT WO 94 02595 Draper et al. PCT WO93 23569 Beigelman et al. PCT WO99 05094 and Klimuk et al. PCT WO99 04819 all of which are incorporated by reference herein.

Alternatively certain siRNA molecules can be expressed within cells from eukaryotic promoters. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any nucleic acid can be expressed in eukaryotic cells using the appropriate DNA RNA vector. The activity of such nucleic acids can be augmented by their release from the primary transcript by an enzymatic nucleic acid Draper et al. PCT WO 93 23569 and Sullivan et al. PCT WO 94 02595 .

In other examples siRNA molecules can be expressed from transcription units see for example Couture et al. 1996 TIG 12 510 inserted into DNA or RNA vectors. The recombinant vectors can be DNA plasmids or viral vectors. siRNA expressing viral vectors can be constructed based on for example but not limited to adeno associated virus retrovirus adenovirus lentivirus or alphavirus. In another example pol III based constructs are used to express nucleic acid molecules see for example Thompson U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 902 880 and 6 146 886 .

The recombinant vectors capable of expressing the siRNA molecules can be delivered as described above and persist in target cells. Alternatively viral vectors can be used that provide for transient expression of nucleic acid molecules. Such vectors can be repeatedly administered as necessary. Once expressed the siRNA molecule interacts with the target mRNA and generates an RNAi response. Delivery of siRNA molecule expressing vectors can be systemic such as by intravenous or intramuscular administration by administration to target cells ex planted from a subject followed by reintroduction into the subject or by any other means that would allow for introduction into the desired target cell.

One of ordinary skill in the art can readily generate antibodies which specifically bind to the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. These antibodies can be monoclonal or polyclonal. They can be chimeric or humanized. Any functional fragment or derivative of an antibody can be used including Fab Fab Fab2 Fab 2 and single chain variable regions. So long as the fragment or derivative retains specificity of binding for the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule it can be used in the methods provided herein. Antibodies can be tested for specificity of binding by comparing binding to appropriate antigen to binding to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture under a given set of conditions. If the antibody binds to appropriate antigen at least 2 at least 5 at least 7 or 10 times more than to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture then it is considered to be specific.

In an example monoclonal antibodies are generated to the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules disclosed in Tables 1 2 4 or 5 that are upregulated in ovarian endothelial cell tumor cells. These monoclonal antibodies each include a variable heavy V and a variable light V chain and specifically bind to the specific ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. For example the antibody can bind the specific ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules with an affinity constant of at least 10M such as at least 10M at least 10M at least 5 10M or at least 10M.

The specific antibodies can include a Vpolypeptide having amino acid sequences of the complementarity determining regions CDRs that are at least about 90 identical such as at least about 95 at least about 98 or at least about 99 identical to the amino acid sequences of the specific ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules and a Vpolypeptide having amino acid sequences of the CDRs that are at least about 90 identical such as at least about 95 at least about 98 or at least about 99 identical to the amino acid sequences of the specific ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules.

In one example the sequence of the specificity determining regions of each CDR is determined Residues that are outside the SDR non ligand contacting sites are substituted. For example in any of the CDR sequences at most one two or three amino acids can be substituted. The production of chimeric antibodies which include a framework region from one antibody and the CDRs from a different antibody is well known in the art. For example humanized antibodies can be routinely produced. The antibody or antibody fragment can be a humanized immunoglobulin having CDRs from a donor monoclonal antibody that binds one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules and immunoglobulin and heavy and light chain variable region frameworks from human acceptor immunoglobulin heavy and light chain frameworks. Generally the humanized immunoglobulin specifically binds to one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules with an affinity constant of at least 10M such as at least 10Mat least 5 10Mor at least 10M.

In another example human monoclonal antibodies to the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules in Tables 1 2 4 and 5 that are upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells are produced. Human monoclonal antibodies can be produced by transferring donor complementarity determining regions CDRs from heavy and light variable chains of the donor mouse immunoglobulin into a human variable domain and then substituting human residues in the framework regions when required to retain affinity. The use of antibody components derived from humanized monoclonal antibodies obviates potential problems associated with the immunogenicity of the constant regions of the donor antibody. For example when mouse monoclonal antibodies are used therapeutically the development of human anti mouse antibodies HAMA leads to clearance of the murine monoclonal antibodies and other possible adverse events. Chimeric monoclonal antibodies with human constant regions humanized monoclonal antibodies retaining only murine CDRs and fully human monoclonal antibodies made from phage libraries or transgenic mice have all been used to reduce or eliminate the murine content of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.

Techniques for producing humanized monoclonal antibodies are described for example by Jones et al. 321 522 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1988 Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 Sandhu 12 437 1992 and Singer et al. 150 2844 1993. The antibody may be of any isotype but in several embodiments the antibody is an IgG including but not limited to IgG IgG IgGand IgG.

In one example the sequence of the humanized immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework can be at least about 65 identical to the sequence of the donor immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. Thus the sequence of the humanized immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework can be at least about 75 at least about 85 at least about 99 or at least about 95 identical to the sequence of the donor immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. Human framework regions and mutations that can be made in a humanized antibody framework regions are known in the art see for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 .

Antibodies such as murine monoclonal antibodies chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies include full length molecules as well as fragments thereof such as Fab F ab and Fv which include a heavy chain and light chain variable region and are capable of binding the epitopic determinant. These antibody fragments retain some ability to selectively bind with their epitope. These fragments include 1 Fab the fragment which contains a monovalent antigen binding fragment of an antibody molecule can be produced by digestion of whole antibody with the enzyme papain to yield an intact light chain and a portion of one heavy chain 2 Fab the fragment of an antibody molecule can be obtained by treating whole antibody with pepsin followed by reduction to yield an intact light chain and a portion of the heavy chain two Fab fragments are obtained per antibody molecule 3 Fab the fragment of the antibody that can be obtained by treating whole antibody with the enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction F ab is a dimer of two Fab fragments held together by two disulfide bonds 4 Fv a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable region of the light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain expressed as two chains and 5 Single chain antibody such as scFv defined as a genetically engineered molecule containing the variable region of the light chain the variable region of the heavy chain linked by a suitable polypeptide linker as a genetically fused single chain molecule. Methods of making these fragments are known in the art see for example Harlow and Lane Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory New York 1988. Fv antibodies are typically about 25 kDa and contain a complete antigen binding site with three CDRs per each heavy chain and each light chain. To produce these antibodies the Vand the Vcan be expressed from two individual nucleic acid constructs in a host cell. If the Vand the Vare expressed non contiguously the chains of the Fv antibody are typically held together by noncovalent interactions. However these chains tend to dissociate upon dilution so methods have been developed to crosslink the chains through glutaraldehyde intermolecular disulfides or a peptide linker. Thus in one example the Fv can be a disulfide stabilized Fv dsFv wherein the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region are chemically linked by disulfide bonds.

In an additional example the Fv fragments include Vand Vchains connected by a peptide linker. These single chain antigen binding proteins scFv are prepared by constructing a structural gene comprising DNA sequences encoding the Vand Vdomains connected by an oligonucleotide. The structural gene is inserted into an expression vector which is subsequently introduced into a host cell such as . The recombinant host cells synthesize a single polypeptide chain with a linker peptide bridging the two V domains. Methods for producing scFvs are known in the art see Whitlow et al. Vol. 2 page 97 1991 Bird et al. 242 423 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 Pack et al. 11 1271 1993 and Sandhu supra .

Antibody fragments can be prepared by proteolytic hydrolysis of the antibody or by expression in of DNA encoding the fragment. Antibody fragments can be obtained by pepsin or papain digestion of whole antibodies by conventional methods. For example antibody fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with pepsin to provide a 5S fragment denoted F ab . This fragment can be further cleaved using a thiol reducing agent and optionally a blocking group for the sulfhydryl groups resulting from cleavage of disulfide linkages to produce 3.5S Fab monovalent fragments. Alternatively an enzymatic cleavage using pepsin produces two monovalent Fab fragments and an Fc fragment directly see U.S. Pat. No. 4 036 945 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 331 647 and references contained therein Nisonhoff et al. 89 230 1960 Porter 73 119 1959 Edelman et al. Vol. 1 page 422 Academic Press 1967 and Coligan et al. at sections 2.8.1 2.8.10 and 2.10.1 2.10.4 .

Other methods of cleaving antibodies such as separation of heavy chains to form monovalent light heavy chain fragments further cleavage of fragments or other enzymatic chemical or genetic techniques may also be used so long as the fragments bind to the antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody.

One of skill will realize that conservative variants of the antibodies can be produced. Such conservative variants employed in antibody fragments such as dsFv fragments or in scFv fragments will retain critical amino acid residues necessary for correct folding and stabilizing between the Vand the Vregions and will retain the charge characteristics of the residues in order to preserve the low pI and low toxicity of the molecules Amino acid substitutions such as at most one at most two at most three at most four or at most five amino acid substitutions can be made in the Vand the Vregions to increase yield. Conservative amino acid substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The following six groups are examples of amino acids that are considered to be conservative substitutions for one another 1 Alanine A Serine S Threonine T 2 Aspartic acid D Glutamic acid E 3 Asparagine N Glutamine Q 4 Arginine R Lysine K 5 Isoleucine I Leucine L Methionine M Valine V and 6 Phenylalanine F Tyrosine Y Tryptophan W .

In some examples naked antibodies can be administered at least 5 mg per kg every two weeks such as at least 10 mg per kg at least 25 mg per kg at least 30 mg per kg at least 50 mg per kg for example 6 7 8 9 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 mg per kg at least once a week at least once every 2 weeks at least once every 3 weeks or at least once every month depending upon the ovarian cancer. In an example the antibodies are administered continuously. In another example antibodies or antibody fragments conjugated to cytotoxic agents immunotoxins are administered at least 10 g per kg such as at least 20 at least 30 at least 50 at least 70 at least 100 g per kg at least twice a week at least once a week at least once every two weeks at least once every month depending upon the ovarian cancer. In one example 50 g per kg is administered twice a week for 2 to 3 weeks. In other examples the subject is administered the therapeutic composition that a binding agent specific for one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules daily for a period of at least 30 days such as at least 2 months at least 4 months at least 6 months at least 12 months at least 24 months or at least 36 months. Subjects can be monitored by methods known to those skilled in the art to determine ovarian tumor responsiveness to the antibody treatment. The subject can be monitored by non invasive techniques such as CT or MRI imaging to assess tumor response. It is contemplated that additional agents can be administered such as antineoplastic agents in combination with or following treatment with the antibodies.

Methods are disclosed herein for determining the effectiveness of a binding agent specific for one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules for the treatment of an ovarian tumor in a subject with the ovarian tumor. In an example the method includes detecting expression of an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in a sample from the subject following administration of the binding agent such as an siRNA for example at least 24 hours at least 1 week at least 2 weeks or at least 4 weeks following administration of the agent. The expression of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule following administration can be compared to a control such as a reference value. An alteration in the expression of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule relative to the control following administration indicates that the agent is effective for the treatment of the ovarian cancer in the subject.

In a specific example the method includes detecting and comparing the protein expression levels of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. In other examples the method includes detecting and comparing the mRNA expression levels of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. In certain examples the treatment is considered effective if the expression levels are altered by at least 2 fold such as by at least 3 fold at least 4 fold at least 6 fold or at least 10 fold relative to the control.

In one example the specific ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule is detected in a biological sample. In a particular example the biological sample is a tumor biopsy. In another example the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule is detected in a serum sample. For example the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule is detected in a serum sample if the specific molecule is known to be secreted or located on a cell surface susceptible to enzymatic cleavage.

In an example an alteration in the expression of one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules following administration includes an increase or decrease in production of a gene product expression such as RNA or protein. For example an alteration can include processes that downregulate or decrease transcription of a gene or translation of mRNA whose expression or activity is increased in ovarian endothelial tumor cells. Gene downregulation includes any detectable decrease in the production of a gene product. In certain examples production expression of a gene product decreases by at least 2 fold for example at least 3 fold at least 4 fold at least 6 fold or at least 10 fold as compared to a control. Exemplary ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that are up regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells are presented in Tables 1 2 4 and 5. Thus a decrease in the expression of one or more of the molecules listed in Tables 1 2 4 or 5 that is noted as being up regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells following treatment indicates that the agent is of use for treating the ovarian cancer.

Exemplary ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that are down regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells are presented in Table 1 with specific examples provided in Table 3. Thus an increase in the expression of one or more of the molecules listed in Table 3 following administration indicates that the agent is effective for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

In another example an alteration can include processes that increase transcription of a gene or translation of mRNA. Gene up regulation includes any detectable increase in the production of a gene product. In certain examples production expression of a gene product increases by at least 2 fold for example at least 3 fold or at least 4 fold at least 6 fold at least 10 fold or at least 28 fold following treatment as compared to a control.

Nucleic acids can be detected by any method known in the art. In some examples nucleic acids are isolated amplified or both prior to detection. In an example the biological sample can be incubated with primers that permit the amplification of one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated mRNAs under conditions sufficient to permit amplification of such products. For example the biological sample is incubated with probes that can bind to one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated nucleic acid sequences such as cDNA genomic DNA or RNA such as mRNA under high stringency conditions. The resulting hybridization can then be detected using methods known in the art. In one example the effectiveness of an ovarian tumor treatment is identified by applying isolated nucleic acid molecules to an array in which the isolated nucleic acid molecules are obtained from a biological sample including ovarian endothelial cancer cells following treatment with the ovarian tumor treatment. In such example the array includes oligonucleotides complementary to all ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated genes listed in Table 1. In a particular example the array is a commercially available array such as a U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide array from AFFYMETRIX AFFYMETRIX Santa Clara Calif. .

In an example the isolated nucleic acid molecules are incubated with the array including oligonucleotides complementary to the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that are up regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells such as those listed in Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 and or Table 5 for a time sufficient to allow hybridization between the isolated nucleic acid molecules and oligonucleotide probes thereby forming isolated nucleic acid molecule oligonucleotide complexes. The isolated nucleic acid molecule oligonucleotide complexes are then analyzed to determine if expression of the isolated nucleic acid molecules is altered. In such example an ovarian tumor treatment is effective if a decrease in the expression of ovarian endothelial tumor associated molecules is observed as compared to a control such as a normal endothelial cell or reference value. In an additional example the array includes oligonucleotides complementary to the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that down regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells such as those listed in Table 3. In this example an ovarian tumor treatment is effective if an increase in the expression of one or more ovarian endothelial tumor associated molecules is observed.

A gene expression profile is disclosed herein that can be used to identify the effectiveness of an ovarian tumor treatment. In an example the gene expression profile includes at least two of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Table 1 such as at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 100 at least 150 at least 200 at least 250 at least 300 at least 400 at least 500 at least 600 at least 700 at least 800 at least 900 at least 1000 or at least 1100 molecules for example 2 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 120 130 140 150 175 225 275 325 350 375 450 550 650 750 850 950 1050 or 1149 of those listed .

In a particular example the gene expression profile includes at least 2 at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 20 at least 25 at least 27 molecules for example 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 22 24 25 26 27 28 or 29 molecules listed in Table 2 Table 4 and or Table 5 that are associated with an at least six fold increase in expression in tumor endothelial cells. In a particular example the at least two molecules include EGFL6 and TNFAIP6. In other particular examples the at least two ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules include EGFL6 TNFAIP6 TWIST1 STC1 HOP CSPG2 and PLXDC1.

In other particular examples the gene expression profile includes at least 2 at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 13 or at least 15 molecules for example 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 or 17 molecules that are down regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells as listed in Table 3. For example the profile includes the seventeen ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Table 3.

As an alternative to analyzing the sample for the presence of nucleic acids the presence of proteins can be determined. Proteins can be detected by any method known in the art. In some examples proteins are purified prior to detection. For example the effect of an ovarian tumor treatment can be determined by incubating the biological sample with one or more antibodies that specifically binds to one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated proteins encoded by the genes listed in Tables 1 Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 or Table 5 to detect expression. The primary antibody can include a detectable label. For example the primary antibody can be directly labeled or the sample can be subsequently incubated with a secondary antibody that is labeled for example with a fluorescent label . The label can then be detected for example by microscopy ELISA flow cytometry or spectrophotometry. In another example the biological sample is analyzed by Western blotting for the presence or absence of the specific ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule. In other examples the biological sample is analyzed by mass spectrometry for the presence or absence of the specific ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule.

In one example the antibody that specifically binds an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule such as those listed in Table 1 is directly labeled with a detectable label. In another example each antibody that specifically binds an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule the first antibody is unlabeled and a second antibody or other molecule that can bind the human antibody that specifically binds the respective ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule is labeled. As is well known to one of skill in the art a second antibody is chosen that is able to specifically bind the specific species and class of the first antibody. For example if the first antibody is a human IgG then the secondary antibody can be an anti human IgG. Other molecules that can bind to antibodies include without limitation Protein A and Protein G both of which are available commercially.

Suitable labels for the antibody or secondary antibody include various enzymes prosthetic groups fluorescent materials luminescent materials magnetic agents and radioactive materials. Non limiting examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase beta galactosidase or acetylcholinesterase. Non limiting examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin biotin and avidin biotin. Non limiting examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone fluorescein fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin A non limiting exemplary luminescent material is luminol a non limiting exemplary magnetic agent is gadolinium and non limiting exemplary radioactive labels include I I S or H.

In an alternative example ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules can be assayed in a biological sample by a competition immunoassay utilizing ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule standards labeled with a detectable substance and unlabeled antibody that specifically bind to the desired ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule. In this assay the biological sample such as serum tissue biopsy or cells isolated from a tissue biopsy the labeled ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule standards and the antibody that specifically binds to ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule are combined and the amount of labeled ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule standard bound to the unlabeled antibody is determined. The amount of ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the biological sample is inversely proportional to the amount of labeled ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule standard bound to the antibody that specifically binds the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule.

Methods are provided herein for identifying agents to treat an ovarian cancer. For example agents that decrease expression or activity of a gene that is upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells such as those listed in Tables 2 and 4 as well as agents that increase activity of a gene that is downregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells such as those listed in Table 3 can be identified using these methods. In an example the method includes contacting an ovarian tumor endothelial cell with one or more test agents under conditions sufficient for the one or more test agents to alter the activity of at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule listed in any of Tables 1 5. It is contemplated that several doses of the agent can be tested and then expression levels of nucleic acids or proteins can be determined. The method also includes detecting the activity or expression of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the presence and absence of the one or more test agents. The activity or expression of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the presence of the one or more test agents is then compared to the activity or expression of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the absence of such agents to determine if there is differential expression of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule. In several examples differential expression of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the presence of the agent as compared to expression in the absence of the agent indicates that the one or more test agents is of use to treat the ovarian tumor.

In an example determining whether there is differential expression of one or more ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules includes generating a gene expression profile for the subject. For example a gene expression profile for the subject can be generated by using an array of molecules including an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated expression profile.

Ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules can include nucleic acid sequences such as DNA cDNA or mRNAs and proteins. In a specific example detecting differential expression of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules includes detecting differential mRNA expression of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. For example such differential expression can be measured by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or microarray analysis or other methods known in the art. In another example detecting differential expression of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules includes detecting differential protein expression of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. For example protein differential expression is measured by Western blot analysis or a protein microarray.

The one or more test agents can be any substance including but not limited to a protein such as an antibody a nucleic acid molecule such as a siRNA an organic compound an inorganic compound a small molecule or any other molecule of interest. In a particular example the test agent is a siRNA that reduces or inhibits the activity such as the expression of one of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Tables 2 4 or 5. For example the siRNA is directed to an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule listed in Table 2 4 or 5 which is involved in angiogenesis such as a molecule that is involved in at least one of cell proliferation tube formation or cell motility.

In other examples the test agent is an antibody. For example the antibody is directed to specifically bind to an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated protein encoded by one of the genes listed in any of Tables 1 2 4 or 5 that are upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells. In a particular example the antibody is directed to an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated protein encoded by one of the genes listed in Tables 2 4 or 5 that is upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells and which is involved in angiogenesis such as a gene that is involved in at least one of cell proliferation tube formation or cell motility. In another example the test agent is a nucleic acid encoding one or more of the proteins listed in Table 3. For example the nucleic acid can be part of a vector suitable for gene therapy.

In an example an alteration in the activity of one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules includes an increase or decrease in production of a gene product such as RNA or protein. For example an alteration can include processes that downregulate or decrease transcription of a gene or translation of mRNA. Gene downregulation includes any detectable decrease in the production of a gene product. In certain examples production expression of a gene product decreases by at least 2 fold for example at least 3 fold at least 4 fold at least 6 fold or at least 10 fold as compared to a control such as a reference value or a normal endothelial cell . For example a decrease in one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules up regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells such as those listed in Tables 2 4 and 5 is indicative of an agent that is effective at treating ovarian cancer.

In another example an alteration can include processes that increase transcription of a gene or translation of mRNA. Gene up regulation includes any detectable increase in the production of a gene product. In certain examples production expression of a gene product increases by at least 2 fold for example at least 3 fold or at least 4 fold at least 6 fold at least 10 fold or at least 28 fold as compared to a control. For example an increase in one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules down regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells such as those listed in Table 3 is indicative of an agent that is effective at treating ovarian cancer.

Nucleic acids can be detected by any method known in the art such as those described above. In one example a therapeutic agent is identified by applying isolated nucleic acid molecules to an array in which the isolated nucleic acid molecules are obtained from a biological sample including ovarian endothelial cancer cells following treatment with the one or more test agents. In such example the array includes oligonucleotides complementary to all ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated genes listed in Table 1. In a particular example the array is a commercially available array such as a U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide array from AFFYMETRIX AFFYMETRIX Santa Clara Calif. .

In an example the isolated nucleic acid molecules are incubated with the array including oligonucleotides complementary to the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Table 2 4 and or 5 for a time sufficient to allow hybridization between the isolated nucleic acid molecules and oligonucleotide probes thereby forming isolated nucleic acid molecule oligonucleotide complexes. The isolated nucleic acid molecule oligonucleotide complexes are then analyzed to determine if expression of the isolated nucleic acid molecules is altered. In such example an agent is considered is effective if the test agent decreases expression of ovarian endothelial tumor associated molecules upregulated in ovarian endothelial cell tumors relative to the absence of the agent such as a decrease of at least 2 3 4 5 or 10 fold . Similarly an agent is considered is effective if the test agent increases expression of ovarian endothelial tumor associated molecules downregulated in ovarian endothelial cell tumors relative to the absence of the agent such as an increase of at least 2 3 4 5 or 10 fold .

The disclosed gene profile as described above can also be used to identify agents to treat an ovarian tumor such as a cancer in a subject. In an example the gene expression profile includes at least two of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Table 1 such as at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 100 at least 150 at least 200 at least 250 at least 300 at least 400 at least 500 at least 600 at least 700 at least 800 at least 900 at least 1000 or at least 1100 molecules for example 2 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 120 130 140 150 175 225 275 325 350 375 450 550 650 750 850 950 1050 or 1149 of those listed .

In a particular example the gene expression profile includes at least 2 at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 20 at least 25 or at least 27 molecules for example 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 22 24 25 26 27 28 or 29 molecules listed in Table 2 4 and or 5 that are associated with an at least six fold increase in expression in tumor endothelial cells. In a particular example the at least two molecules include EGFL6 and TNFAIP6. In other particular examples the at least two ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules include EGFL6 TNFAIP6 TWIST1 STC1 HOP CSPG2 and PLXDC1.

In other particular examples the gene expression profile includes at least 2 at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 13 or at least 15 molecules for example 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 or 17 molecules that are down regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells as listed in Table 3. For example the profile includes the seventeen ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Table 3.

As an alternative to analyzing the sample for the presence of nucleic acids the presence of proteins can be determined using any method known in the art. In some examples proteins are purified before detection. For example the effect of one or more test agents on an ovarian tumor can be determined by incubating the biological sample with an antibody that specifically binds to one of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated proteins encoded by the genes listed in Tables 1 5. The primary antibody can include a detectable label. For example the primary antibody can be directly labeled or the sample can be subsequently incubated with a secondary antibody that is labeled for example with a fluorescent label . The label can then be detected for example by microscopy ELISA flow cytometry or spectrophotometry. In another example the biological sample is analyzed by Western blotting for the presence or absence of the specific ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule. In some examples the biological sample is analyzed by mass spectrometry.

In one example the antibody that specifically binds an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule such as those listed in Table 1 is directly labeled with a detectable label. In another example each antibody that specifically binds an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule the first antibody is unlabeled and a second antibody or other molecule that can bind the human antibody that specifically binds the respective ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule is labeled. As is well known to one of skill in the art a second antibody is chosen that is able to specifically bind the specific species and class of the first antibody. For example if the first antibody is a human IgG then the secondary antibody can be an anti human IgG. Other molecules that can bind to antibodies include without limitation Protein A and Protein G both of which are available commercially.

Suitable labels for the antibody or secondary antibody include various enzymes prosthetic groups fluorescent materials luminescent materials magnetic agents and radioactive materials. Non limiting examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase beta galactosidase or acetylcholinesterase. Non limiting examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin biotin and avidin biotin. Non limiting examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone fluorescein fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin A non limiting exemplary luminescent material is luminol a non limiting exemplary magnetic agent is gadolinium and non limiting exemplary radioactive labels include I I S or H.

In an alternative example ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules can be assayed in a biological sample by a competition immunoassay utilizing ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule standards labeled with a detectable substance and an unlabeled antibody that specifically binds the desired ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule. In this assay the biological sample such as serum tissue biopsy or cells isolated from a tissue biopsy the labeled ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule standards and the antibody that specifically binds the desired ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule are combined and the amount of labeled ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule standard bound to the unlabeled antibody is determined. The amount of ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the biological sample is inversely proportional to the amount of labeled ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule standard bound to the antibody that specifically binds the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule.

Metastasis is a major complication in the pathogenesis of tumors such as ovarian cancer and is typically indicative of poor prognosis. It is also known that angiogenesis is a crucial factor in the progression of solid tumors and metastases including ovarian cancer. The formation of the vascular stroma plays an important role in the pathophysiology of malignancy. For instance in the absence of vascular support tumors may become necrotic or even apoptotic. In contrast the onset of angiogenesis marks a phase of rapid proliferation local invasion and ultimately metastasis.

Without wishing to be bound to a particular theory it is proposed that an alteration in the expression of the disclosed ovarian endothelial tumor associated molecules associated with angiogenesis such as molecules involved in cell proliferation cell motility or tube formation including those disclosed in such as EZH2 is related to enhanced ovarian tumor cell metastasis and a poor clinical outcome. Thus methods of diagnosing or prognosing an ovarian tumor that overexpresses at least one pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule such as those listed in Tables 1 2 4 and 5 that are upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells e.g. EZH2 or underexpresses at least one proangiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule such as those listed in Tables 1 and 3 that are downregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells are disclosed. In some examples such methods can be used to identify those subjects that will benefit from the disclosed treatment methods. For example such diagnostic methods can be performed prior to the subject undergoing the treatments described above. In other examples these methods are utilized to predict the metastatic potential of the ovarian cancer a poor prognosis or combinations thereof. In one particular example these methods are utilized to predict a poor prognosis such as to indicate a decreased survival time.

In an example the method includes detecting expression of at least one angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule listed in Tables 1 5 such as at least two at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 100 at least 150 at least 200 ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules related to angiogenesis for example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 17 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 100 125 150 175 200 or 250 listed in Tables 1 5 in a sample from the subject exhibiting one or more symptoms associated with ovarian cancer.

In an example the specific angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule such as EZH2 is detected in a biological sample. In a particular example the biological sample is a sample taken from a subject with ovarian epithelial cancer. In a particular example the biological sample is a tumor biopsy. In another example the angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule is detected in a serum sample. For example the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule is detected in a serum sample if the specific molecule is secreted or located on a cell surface susceptible to enzymatic cleavage.

In one example detection of at least one angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule listed in any of Tables 1 2 3 4 or 5 such as detection of EZH2 in a biological sample from the subject is used to diagnose or prognose an ovarian tumor. Methods of detecting such molecules in a sample are known in the art and are routine. In some examples the relative amount of pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules present is determined for example by quantitating the expression level of such molecules. For example the relative or absolute quantity of the at least one angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in a sample can be determined.

The activity such as the expression level of the disclosed pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules in a sample obtained from a subject is compared to a control. In one example an increase in expression of one or more of the angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules upregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells such as those listed in Table 2 as compared to a non tumor control or reference value indicates the presence of an ovarian tumor the ovarian tumor is metastatic the ovarian tumor is likely to become metastatic a poor prognosis or a combination thereof. In some examples a decrease in expression of one or more of the angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules that is downregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells such as those listed in Table 3 or VASH1 as compared to a non tumor control or reference value indicates the presence of an ovarian tumor the ovarian tumor is metastatic the ovarian tumor is likely to become metastatic a poor prognosis or a combination thereof.

For example the level of the angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules such as the level of EZH2 detected can be compared to a non tumor control or reference value such as a value that represents a level of angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules expected if an ovarian tumor is or is not metastatic or is a low grade tumor or early stage tumor. In one example the angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules detected in a tumor sample are compared to the level of such molecules detected in a sample obtained from a subject that does not have an ovarian tumor or has a non metastatic ovarian tumor. In certain examples detection of at least a 2 fold such as by at least 3 fold at least 4 fold at least 6 fold or at least 10 fold alteration in the relative amount of the pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules in a tumor sample as compared to the relative amount of such molecules in a control indicates that the subject has a tumor with metastatic potential has a tumor that has metastasized has a poor prognosis or combinations thereof. In some examples detection of statistically similar relative amounts of pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules observed in a tumor sample as compared to the relative amount of such molecules in a control sample that is not metastatic indicates that that subject does not have a tumor with metastatic potential does not have a tumor that has metastasized has a good prognosis or combinations thereof.

In a specific example the method includes detecting and comparing the nucleic acid expression levels of the pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules such as DNA cDNA or mRNAs. In a specific example the method includes detecting and comparing the mRNA expression levels of the pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. For example such expression can be measured by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or microarray analysis. In a particular example the disclosed gene expression profile is utilized to diagnosis and or prognosis an ovarian tumor.

Nucleic acids can be detected by any method known in the art. In some examples nucleic acids are isolated amplified or both prior to detection. In an example the biological sample can be incubated with primers that permit the amplification of one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated mRNAs under conditions sufficient to permit amplification of such products. For example the biological sample is incubated with probes that can bind to one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated nucleic acid sequences such as cDNA genomic DNA or RNA such as mRNA under high stringency conditions. The resulting hybridization can then be detected using methods known in the art. In one example a therapeutic agent is identified by applying isolated nucleic acid molecules to an array in which the isolated nucleic acid molecules are obtained from a biological sample including ovarian endothelial cancer cells for example following treatment with the one or more test agents. In such example the array includes oligonucleotides complementary to all ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated genes listed in Table 1. In a particular example the array is a commercially available array such as a U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide array from AFFYMETRIX AFFYMETRIX Santa Clara Calif. .

In an example the isolated nucleic acid molecules are incubated with the array including oligonucleotides complementary to the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Tables 2 3 4 and or 5 for a time sufficient to allow hybridization between the isolated nucleic acid molecules and oligonucleotide probes thereby forming isolated nucleic acid molecule oligonucleotide complexes. In a particular example the isolated nucleic acid molecules are incubated with the array including oligonucleotides complementary to at least EZH2. The isolated nucleic acid molecule oligonucleotide complexes are then analyzed to determine if expression of the isolated nucleic acid molecules is altered.

The disclosed gene profile as described above can also be used in the diagnosis and prognosis of an ovarian tumor in a subject. In an example the gene expression profile includes at least two of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Table 1 such as at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 100 at least 150 at least 200 at least 250 at least 300 at least 400 at least 500 at least 600 at least 700 at least 800 at least 900 at least 1000 or at least 1100 molecules for example 2 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 120 130 140 150 175 225 275 325 350 375 450 550 650 750 850 950 1050 or 1149 of those listed .

In a particular example the gene expression profile includes at least 1 at least 3 at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 20 at least 25 or at least 27 molecules for example 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 22 24 25 26 27 28 or 29 molecules listed in Table 2 4 and or 5 that are associated with angiogenesis such as molecules involved in cell proliferation cell motility and or tube formation. In a particular example the at least one molecule includes EZH2

In other particular examples the gene expression profile includes at least 2 at least 5 at least 7 at least 10 at least 13 or at least 15 molecules for example 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 or 17 molecules that are down regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells as listed in Table 3. For example the profile includes the seventeen ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Table 3.

As an alternative to analyzing the sample for the presence of nucleic acids alterations in protein expression can be measured by methods known in the art such as Western blot analysis mass spectrometry immunoassay or a protein microarray as described above . For example the metastatic potential of an ovarian tumor can be determined by using a protein array that includes one or more capture agents such as antibodies that are specific for the one or more disclosed ovarian endothelial tumor associated molecules that are related to angiogenesis such as molecules that play a role in cell proliferation cell motility or tube formation such as EZH2.

Fresh tissue samples 5 normal ovaries and 10 epithelial high grade stage III or IV invasive serous ovarian cancers were obtained from patients undergoing primary surgical exploration at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The minced tissue was digested with collagenase A elastase and DNase 1 at 37 C. for 90 minutes to yield a single cell suspension. A number of negative selections followed including removal of platelets and red blood cells RBCs by Percoll separation removal of epithelial cells using M450 beads which are prebound to BerEP4 antibody removal of leukocytes using anti CD 14 CD 45 and CD 64 beads Dynal Biotech Brown Deer Wis. . Positive selection was performed with P1H12 CD 146 immunobeads P1H12 antibody was from Chemicon Temecula Calif. and the beads linked to secondary antibody were from Dynal Biotech. Immunostaining was then performed using von Willebrand factor and 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole nuclear staining to confirm the purification of endothelial cells. Total RNA Amplification for AFFYMETRIX GENECHIP Hybridization and Image Acquisition. To successfully generate sufficient labeled cRNA for microarray analysis from 25 ng of total RNA two rounds of amplification were necessary. For the first round synthesis of double stranded cDNA 25 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Two Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit AFFYMETRIX Santa Clara Calif. and oligo dT24 T7

This example illustrates the purity of the endothelial cell samples utilized in the disclosed microarray analyses.

According to the methods described in Example 1 samples were immunostained with endothelial cell markers P1H12 and von Willebrand factor to determine endothelial cell purity. Immunostaining revealed that the employed purification technique yielded endothelial cell purity of 95 in all samples. Thus the disclosed isolation technique resulted in a highly pure population of endothelial cells.

According to the methods described in Example 1 gene expression differences in purified endothelial cells from 10 invasive epithelial ovarian cancers and 5 normal non tumor ovaries were determined by using the AFFYMETRIX Human U133 Plus 2.0 Gene Chip platform. The nucleic acid sequence of each AFFYMETRIX probe listed in the tables below is herein incorporated by reference and is available from the AFFYMETRIX website. As illustrated in Table 1 1149 genes were identified as being differentially regulated 2 fold in endothelium derived from epithelial ovarian cancers compared to normal ovarian tissue. A positive fold change indicates the gene was upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor sample and a negative fold change indicates the gene was downregulated in such sample. A multivariate permutation t test p

As indicated in Table 1 652 genes were up regulated 2 fold in ovarian cancer endothelium samples. Of the 652 genes that were up regulated 2 fold 35 genes were elevated at least 6 fold in tumor endothelium Table 2 with 7 being elevated more than 10 fold and 2 being elevated more than 28 fold.

Multiple genes encoding proteins involved in extracellular matrix function such as collagens TNFAIP6 ADAMTS4 MMP9 MMP11 had increased expression in tumor vasculature compared with normal ovarian vasculature. The integrin vitronectin receptor was elevated 2.5 fold in tumor endothelium. Several transcription factors were upregulated in the ovarian cancer vasculature. For example HEYL was increased 3 fold. In addition several transcription factors were identified including E2F transcription factor 3 E2F3 plays a role in cell proliferation Black 102 15948 15953 2005 runt related transcription factor 1 RUNX1 plays a role in angiogenesis Iwatsuki et al. 24 1129 1137 2005 signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 STAT2 role in cellular proliferation Gomez and Reich 170 5373 5381 2003 the SNAIL related zinc finger transcription factor SLUG SNAI2 Perez Mancera et al. 24 3073 3082 2005 and Twist1 Mironchik et al. 65 10801 10809 2005 . These genes were elevated 2 18 fold in the ovarian cancer vasculature relative to normal ovarian endothelial cells.

Additional genes were identified as being overexpressed in ovarian tumor endothelial cells that had previously been reported to be overexpressed in tumor cells. For example epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR expression was increased by 3.5 fold in the tumor endothelium. EGFR is known to be overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas and is predictive of poor outcome Berchuck et al. 164 669 674 1991 . Similarly non receptor kinases such as focal adhesion kinase FAK or PTK2 3.1 fold increase and Fyn 4.7 fold increase which are play functional roles for tumor cells were detected. Genes that are overexpressed on both tumor cells and tumor associated endothelial cells are targets for anti vascular therapy due to the ability to target both the epithelial and stromal compartments.

In addition to the 652 genes that were identified as being up regulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells 497 genes were down regulated 2 fold in ovarian cancer endothelium samples Table 1 . illustrates the fold changes observed in the relative expression levels between microarray data and real time quantitative RT PCR data from the pro angiogenic gene signature provided in Table 1. Of the 497 genes that were down regulated 2 fold 17 genes were decreased at least 6 fold as provide in Table 3 . For example monoamine oxidase B MAOB a gene responsible for detoxification and degradation of monoamines was decreased by 6.4 fold in the tumor endothelial cells Grimsby et al. 17 206 210 1997 . Decorin a small multi functional proteoglycan with anti angiogenic properties was decreased by 4.8 fold Sulochana et al. 280 27935 27948 2005 . Several other genes with potential anti angiogenic or anti proliferative roles such as Fibulin 5 FBLN 5 and checkpoint suppressor 1 CHES1 were down regulated by 4.5 fold and 4.3 fold respectively Albig and Schiemann 23 367 379 2004 and Scott and Plon 359 119 126 2005 . These findings indicate that tumor endothelial cell and non tumor endothelial cell isolates possess distinct expression profiles.

Differentially regulated genes expressed in tumor associated endothelium were identified by comparing tumor associated endothelium versus normal endothelium with tumor associated epithelial cells versus ovarian surface epithelium OSE . The expression profile of microdissected papillary serous ovarian cancers using the same microarray methods has previously been reported Bonome et al. 65 10602 10612 2005 . The current disclosed list of differentially expressed genes in tumor associated endothelial cells was compared with the gene list identified for laser microdissected tumor epithelial cells. A total of 534 differentially regulated genes were uniquely altered up or down regulated in the endothelial cells. The 28 genes with the greatest level of increase in ovarian tumor endothelial cells are listed in Table 4 of which 23 genes had a 6 fold increase in expression. A complete listing of the 534 differentially regulated genes is provided in Table 5. Further illustrates protein expression levels detected in ovarian endothelial cells following staining of samples with immunofluorescently labeled PTK2 Fyn MMP 9 2 arrestin Jagged1 and PLXDC1 respectively.

These findings identify tumor endothelial cell specific genes that can be used as biomarkers and potential targets for treatment of ovarian cancer.

This example provides further support for the use of the endothelial cell tumor associated molecules provided in Examples 3 and 4 to identify ovarian tumor endothelial cells.

To substantiate the findings provided by the microarray analysis described in Examples 3 and 4 a series of 17 genes were selected at random spanning a range of fold changes 3.6 to 155.3 . Of 17 primer sets 15 yielded specific qRT PCR products when analyzed using Universal Human Reference RNA Stratagene La Jolla Calif. with 13 reaching statistical significance in tumor n 10 and normal n 5 isolates p

To further examine whether the gene expression alterations identified by the microarray analysis also occur at the protein level immunohistochemical staining was performed for selected proteins on 5 normal ovaries and 5 invasive epithelial ovarian cancers. The microarray analysis identified FAK PTK2 3.1 fold Fyn 4.7 fold MMP 9 9.4 fold 2 arrestin 4.8 fold Jagged1 4.3 fold and PLXDC1 10.2 fold as being significantly increased in tumor associated endothelial cells and these changes were validated by real time RT PCR.

Immunohistochemical peroxidase staining confirmed that both FAK and Fyn were indeed overexpressed in the tumor associated endothelial cells in all samples. There were no obvious differences in protein expression between arterioles and venules. Similarly increased expression of MMP 9 2 arrestin Jagged1 and PLXDC1 was also confirmed at the protein level . These results provide further support for the use of the specific endothelial cell tumor associated molecules provided in Examples 3 and 4 to identify ovarian tumor endothelial cells.

This example illustrates signaling pathways that are modulated in tumor endothelium and their functional significance.

Ovarian epithelial carcinomas arise from molecular events occurring in the epithelial layer which affect changes in gene expression within surrounding non epithelial cell populations. For endothelial cells this altered signaling environment stimulates proliferation migration and tumor vascularization. To identify epithelial genes that may be responsible for these changes and the endothelial signaling pathways that are impacted a series of laser microdissected papillary serous epithelial cell isolates and ovarian surface epithelial brushings were compared as previously described Bonome et al. 65 10602 10612 2005 . Pathway diagrams were generated using Pathway Assist version 3.0 software. The genes comprising the pathway indicate involvement in endothelial cell proliferation tube formation and cell motility.

To test the biological significance of some of these genes three genes were selected EZH2 Jagged1 and PTK2 EZH2 plays an important role in many biological processes and is downstream of Akt activation making it a potential anti angiogenic target. siRNA was used to inhibit EZH2 expression in HUVEC cells and its effects on tube formation and migration were examined. In comparison to control non silencing siRNA EZH2 silencing resulted in an 85 decrease in endothelial tube formation on Matrigel EZH2 targeted siRNA completely blocked VEGF stimulated migration of HUVEC cells . Similarly to determine the functional relevance of Jagged1 for endothelial cell function the effects of inhibiting Jagged1 expression with siRNA were evaluated on tube formation and migration . Jagged1 targeted siRNA reduced tube formation by 80 and blocked VEGF stimulated HUVEC migration . Similar results were noted with PTK2 expression inhibition with PTK2 targeted siRNA . These data indicate that the novel differentially expressed genes in the tumor associated endothelial cells play functionally significant roles in angiogenesis.

The ability of siRNA to be delivered directly into ovarian tumor cells was investigated by staining tumor tissues with A primary rat anti mouse CD31 antibody to detect endothelial cells and B anti f4 80 to detect scavenging macrophages and then Alexa 488 tagged secondary antibody. Fluorescent siRNA was not only trapped onto blood vessels but was also effectively delivered deep into tumor parenchyma. Macrophages were observed to surround nests of tumor cells that contained perinuclear siRNA and had less amount of siRNA compared to tumor cells suggesting that siRNAs were delivered directly into the tumor cells.

The effect of mouse EZH2 siRNA on EZH2 expression in mouse ovarian endothelial cells was also determined. Cells were trypsinized at different time intervals 24 h 48 h and 72 h after transfection with mouse EZH2 siRNA and checked for EZH2 mRNA down regulation using RT PCR analysis. As illustrated in EZH2 gene expression was significantly decreased after 24 hours of treatment indicating that the administered siRNA was capable of down regulating EZH2 mRNA in vitro.

This example describes methods for significantly reducing ovarian tumor growth and vascularization in a mouse model. One of skill in the art will appreciate that similar methods can be used in other mammals and other siRNAs can be used in place of those described herein. Further a conversion formula known to those of skill in the art can be employed to determine the appropriate doses in other mammals including humans.

Nude mice were injected via i.p. with either 2.5 10HeyA8 or 1.0 10SKOV3ip1 cells. Mice were randomly divided into 4 groups 1 control siRNA chitosan 2 mouse EZH2 siRNA chitosan 3 Human EZH2 siRNA chitosan and 4 combination of mouse plus human EZH2 siRNA chitosan. Therapy was started on the seventh day by injecting chitosan siRNA twice weekly 150 g kg . Therapy was started on the seventh day by injecting chitosan siRNA twice weekly 150 g kg . Animals were sacrificed when mice became moribund 3 5 weeks after cell injection . Mouse weight tumor weight number of tumor nodules and tumor location were recorded. As illustrated in mice treated with mouse EZH2 siRNA exhibited significant decrease in tumor burden compared to control siRNA 70 and 42 reduction in tumor weight of HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 respectively p 0.05 . Human EZH2 siRNA also reduced the tumor burden 50 in HeyA8 and 24 reduction in SKOV3ip1 p 0.05 of only HeyA8 tumors compared to mouse targeted EZH2 siRNA. However the greatest reduction was observed when treating the mouse with a combination of mouse plus human EZH2 siRNA 84 and 65 reduction in HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 tumors respectively p 0.001 . In the case of tumor nodules again combination of mouse plus human EZH2 siRNA group consistently produced fewer tumor nodules with 75 and 53 reduction compared to control group p 0.05 . The effect of EZH2 siRNA on microvessel density was determined by harvesting tumors from the four different groups stated above and staining such tumors for CD31. The mouse targeted EZH2 siRNA group showed decreased number of blood vessels compared to human EZH2 siRNA and control siRNA treated tumors. Microvessel density of the combination treated group using both mouse and human EZH2 siRNA was significantly reduced when compared to that of the control group. These studies demonstrate the ability of EZH2 targeted siRNA to inhibit tumor growth and vascularization in vivo.

This example illustrates that increased EZH2 expression in either tumor cells or in tumor vasculature is predictive of poor clinical outcome and that the anti angiogenesis effect of EZH2 silencing is mediated via silencing VASH1.

One hundred and thirty paraffin embedded epithelial ovarian cancer specimens with available clinical outcome data and confirmed diagnosis by a board certified gynecologic pathologist were obtained from the Karmanos Cancer Institute tumor bank. All patients were diagnosed from 1985 to 2004 following primary cytoreductive surgery. Slides of tumor samples were obtained for EZH2 CD34 and VEGF expression analysis. Clinical variables obtained for correlative analyses included age at diagnosis tumor stage and grade and vital status of patients relative to disease specific survival at the time of chart review. Cell Lines and Culture. The HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 human epithelial ovarian cancer cells were maintained as described previously. The derivation and characterization of the murine ovarian endothelial cells MOEC has been described previously. The EAhy926 endothelial hybridoma cell line was provided by Dr. Robert Danner CCMD NIH and was maintained as described previously with sodium hypoxanthine and thymidine HT supplement Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. instead of sodium hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT supplement Invitrogen . HUVEC were purchased from Cambrex Walkersville Md. and maintained with heparin and gentamicin amphotericin B as previously described. EZH2 Promoter Construct. The EZH2 promoter was amplified by PCR from the Roswell Park Cancer Institute RPCI human BAC library 11 Clone ID RP11 992C19 purchased from the Children s Hospital Oakland Research Institute Oakland Calif. and then cloned into the pGL3 Basic Vector Promega Corp. Madison Wis. . The EZH2 promoter construct was amplified using primers Table 6 with XhoI and HindIII restriction endonuclease sites added to the ends. Purified PCR product was then cloned upstream of the luc gene in the pGL3 Basic Vector Promega Corp. using XhoI and HindIII.

To assess tumor growth for long term therapy experiments treatment began 1 week after intraperitoneal injection of tumor cells. Mice were divided into 4 groups n 10 mice per group a control siRNA CH b EZH2 Hs siRNA CH c EZH2 Mm siRNA CH and d EZH2 Hs siRNA CH plus EZH2 Mm siRNA CH. VASH1 gene silencing effects was determined using same cells and mice were divided into 6 groups. a Control siRNA CH b EZH2 Mm siRNA1 CH c EZH2 Mm siRNA2 CH d EZH2 Mm siRNA3 CH e VASH1 Mm siRNA CH and f VASH1 Mm siRNA CH plus EZH2 Mm siRNA CH. Each siRNA was given twice weekly at a dose of 150 g kg body weight. Treatment continued until mice became moribund typically 4 to 5 weeks following tumor cell injection in any group. At the time of sacrifice mouse weight tumor weight number of nodules and distribution of tumors were recorded. The individuals who performed the necropsies tumor collections and tissue processing were blinded to the treatment group assignments.

Localization of EZH2 and CD31 was performed using frozen tissue. Tumors collected after 48 hours of single injection of control siRNA CH or EZH2 Hs siRNA CH or EZH2 Mm siRNA CH or EZH2 Hs siRNA CH plus EZH2 Mm siRNA CH and stained for CD31 and EZH2. Staining for CD31 and desmin was done as described previously. Pericyte coverage was determined by the percent of vessels with 50 or more coverage by the green fluorescence of associated desmin positive cells in 5 random fields at 200 magnification for each tumor. Western Blot Analysis. Western blot analysis for EZH2 expression histone3 Lys27 methylation in vitro and EZH2 expression for in vivo samples was performed as previously reported. Tumors were collected at various time points after 24 48 72 and 96 hours of single injection of control siRNA CH or EZH2 Hs siRNA CH or EZH2 Mm siRNA CH or EZH2 Hs siRNA CH plus EZH2 Mm siRNA CH and lysed to analyze protein levels using Western blotting. EZH2 Gene Silencing in MOEC. Relative expression of EZH2 mRNA in MOEC was determined by transfecting cells with control or EZH2 Mm siRNA and harvested after 72 hours of transfection. Real time quantitative RT PCR was performed using 50 ng total RNA isolated from treated cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit Qiagen . Primer sequences are given in the Table 7. Relative expression values were obtained using the average of 3 reference genes and the 2method as described previously and normalized to control for percent fold changes.

EAhy926 hybridoma endothelial cells were co transfected with the luciferase plasmid and firefly luciferase plasmid either with or without the EZH2 promoter construct. Cells were then treated with VEGF EGF or conditioned media from ovarian cancer cell lines. EZH2 promoter activity was determined by the dual luciferase assay. There was a significant increase in EZH2 promoter activity in endothelial cells in response to VEGF EGF and conditioned media . In order to examine changes in EZH2 message HUVECs were treated as indicated above and expression of EZH2 mRNA was examined using quantitative real time RT PCR. Control values were normalized using 3 housekeeping genes EZH2 mRNA expression levels were induced by 130 240 fold change compared to control in endothelial cells in response to VEGF EGF or the conditioned media . To examine the relationship between EZH2 and VEGF in human samples the expression levels of both genes in 29 microdissected high grade serous papillary ovarian cancers were determined. Pearson s analysis showed a significant correlation between EZH2 and VEGF levels p 0.03 .

To determine the mechanism by which EZH2 silencing could induce anti angiogenic effects a whole genome ChIP on ChIP analysis was performed. The findings indicate that an anti angiogenic gene vasohibin VASH1 directly binds to EZH2. To validate this finding a ChIP assay of EZH2 for the VASH1 promoter in endothelial cells in the presence or absence of VEGF was performed which confirmed direct EZH2 binding to the VASH1 promoter. Next we silenced the EZH2 gene in mouse ovarian endothelial cells MOEC using siRNA which resulted in a 2.8 fold increase in VASH1 .

To determine the mechanism by which EZH2 regulates VASH1 methylation specific PCR was performed for detecting VASH1 methylation in endothelial cells in the presence of VEGF after silencing EZH2 VEGF treatment resulted in a 1.7 fold increase in VASH1 methylation compared to the controls. However EZH2 silencing resulted in a 3.3 fold decrease in VASH1 methylation in the VEGF treated MOEC cells . Specifically EZH2 gene silencing by decreased histone 3 methylation at lysine 27 by 2.5 fold in endothelial cells .

The effect of VEGF on E2F1 5 in MOEC is provided in . There was a significant increase in E2F1 E2F3 and E2F5 following treatment with VEGF . To determine which E2F transcription factors might be responsible for increasing EZH2 levels the effects of VEGF after silencing either E2F1 3 or 5 were determined EZH2 levels were significantly decreased in E2F3 and E2F5 silenced cells . To validate the binding of EZH2 promoter to E2F3 and E2F5 transcription factors ChIP assays of EZH2 to these transcription factors were performed. E2F3 and E2F5 were bound to the EZH2 promoters demonstrating that EZH2 is the direct target of the E2F transcription factors. The studies provide direct explanation for the anti angiogenesis effects observed in response to EZH2 gene silencing.

To determine the role of VASH1 on angiogenesis migration and tube formation studies were performed in MOEC and HUVEC by silencing the VASH1 gene in MOEC and HUVEC. MOEC cells were transfected with control and VASH1 siRNA for 48 hours and then resuspended in serum free media. 75 000 cells were plated on pre gelatin and Matrigel coated Transwell inserts which were placed in the lower chamber of VEGF containing media. Migration and tube formation were significantly increased after VASH1 gene silencing whereas no change in proliferation of cells.

Whether EZH2 silencing in vivo would affect tumor growth and angiogenesis was determined. Before conducting the EZH2 targeted in vivo experiments CH nanoparticles for systemic delivery of siRNA into both tumor cells and tumor associated vasculature were developed and characterize. Several formulations of CH with siRNA siRNA CH were tested and optimized and the 3 1 ratio CH TPP nanoparticles showed the greatest 75 incorporation efficiency . Therefore for all subsequent studies siRNA CHnanoparticles were used due to their small size slight positive charge and high incorporation efficiency of siRNA.

Prior to performing proof of concept in vivo efficacy studies the efficiency of siRNA delivery into orthotopic ovarian tumors was tested. Non silencing siRNA labeled with Alexa 555 was incorporated into CH nanoparticles and injected intravenously i.v. into mice bearing HeyA8 orthotopic tumors 17 days after intraperitoneal inoculation of tumor cells . Tumors were harvested at 15 hours and 3 5 and 7 days 3 mice per time point following injection and examined for extent of siRNA delivery. At all time points punctated emissions of the siRNA were noted in the perinuclear regions of individual cells. SiRNA was noted in 80 of fields examined following a single intravenous injection. To confirm delivery of siRNA in the vasculature slides were also stained for CD31. siRNA was delivered into the tumor associated endothelial cells suggesting potential applications for targeting the tumor vasculature. To confirm intracellular delivery of siRNA 3 dimensional reconstructions of the tumors using confocal microscopy were created. Lateral views of the optical sections clearly demonstrated the presence of siRNA within the tumor cells . However very little siRNA was taken up by macrophages as determined by labeling tissues with f4 80. To examine the delivery of siRNA into other organs sections of liver lung kidney heart spleen and brain were also examined and siRNA delivery was detected in most of these organs.

To examine the in vivo effects of EZH2 gene silencing on tumor growth EZH2 siRNA directed to either the human tumor cells EZH2 Hs siRNA CH or mouse endothelial cells EZH2 Mm siRNA CH sequence were utilized. The specificity of siRNA was confirmed by testing each siRNA in both mouse endothelial MOEC and human tumor HeyA8 cells . Following intravenous injection of either control siRNA CH EZH2 Hs siRNA CH EZH2 Mm siRNA CH or the combination of EZH2 targeted siRNAs into HeyA8 tumor bearing mice n 3 mice per group at each time point tumors were harvested at different time points and examined for EZH2 protein levels EZH2 levels were decreased by 24 hours following single injection of EZH2 Hs siRNA CH with return of expression to baseline expression levels after 96 hours . To determine the localization of EZH2 silencing following siRNA CH administration we performed dual immunofluorescence staining for EZH2 and CD31. This study further demonstrated that EZH2 Hs siRNA CH resulted in EZH2 silencing in the tumor cells whereas EZH2 Mm siRNA CH silenced EZH2 only in the tumor endothelial cells .

To determine the therapeutic efficacy of EZH2 gene silencing a well characterized orthotopic model of ovarian carcinoma was utilized. Seven days following injection tumor cells into the peritoneal cavity mice were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 groups of 10 mice each 1 control siRNA CH 2 EZH2 Hs siRNA CH 3 EZH2 Mm siRNA CH and 4 combination of EZH2 Hs siRNA CH plus EZH2 Mm siRNA CH. Mice were sacrificed when animals appeared moribund due to significant tumor burden 4 to 5 weeks after cell injection depending on the cell line .

Alexa 555 siRNA uptake into macrophages and to various organs was evaluated. Tumor tissues were collected after single injection of untagged control siRNA CH or Alexa 555 siRNA CH nanoparticles and stained with anti f4 80 antibody to detect scavenging macrophages green middle or right panels . Macrophages were seen surrounding nests of tumor cells and had minimal siRNA uptake. Left panel demonstrates lack of natural autofluorescence following injection of untagged control siRNA CH. Images were taken at original magnification 200 left and middle and 400 right . Histological sections were made from the liver kidney lung brain and heart tissues that were collected after intravenous injection of 5 g Alexa 555 siRNA CH nanoparticles and exposed to hematoxylin and eosin H E and Hoechst staining. Left panel represents H E staining middle panel represents natural auto fluorescence of each tissue after a single injection of untagged control siRNA CH and right panel denotes Alexa 555 siRNA CH red . All images were taken at original magnification 200.

As shown in and treatment with EZH2 Mm siRNA CH resulted in a significant decrease in tumor burden compared to control siRNA CH 62 reduction in HeyA8 p

To evaluate the effects of EZH2 on other parameters of tumor growth we examined tumor incidence and number of nodules Table 9 below . The combination of EZH2 Hs siRNA CH plus EZH2 Mm siRNA CH resulted in a significant reduction in tumor nodules in both HeyA8 p 0.002 vs. control siRNA treated group and SKOV3ip1 tumors p 0.004 vs. control siRNA treated group . The decrease in tumor burden occurred despite having comparable tumor incidence. The mean mouse body weight was similar among the different groups suggesting that feeding and drinking habits were not affected.

To determine the potential mechanisms underlying the efficacy of EZH2 silencing on ovarian tumors its effects on several biological end points were examined including MVD pericyte coverage desmin and cell proliferation PCNA . EZH2 Mm siRNA CH and the combination therapy groups had significantly lower microvessel density compared to the EZH2 Hs siRNA CH and control siRNA CH treated tumors. Pericyte coverage was increased in EZH2 Mm siRNA CH and the combination groups compared to other 2 groups suggesting greater vascular maturation . Combination treatment with EZH2 Hs siRNA CH and EZH2 Mm siRNA CH also resulted in a significant reduction in cell proliferation .

To determine the requirement for VASH1 in mediating the anti tumor effects of EZH2 silencing the effects of VASH1 silencing in combination with EZH2 Mm siRNA CH was determined. The anti tumor effect of EZH2 silencing in the tumor vasculature was completely reversed by VASH1 silencing and see Table 7 suggesting that VASH1 is required for mediating the anti tumor effects of EZH2 silencing.

The present results provide a new understanding of the regulation of tumor angiogenesis. A novel mechanism by which VEGF increases EZH2 levels in the tumor vasculature was disclosed which contributes to tumor angiogenesis by inactivating the anti angiogenic factor VASH1 via methylation of VASH1 gene and Histone 3 Lys 27 H3K27 . Moreover a novel and highly efficient method of gene silencing in the tumor cells as well as in the blood vessels that support their growth was developed and characterized. This approach was highly effective for EZH2 silencing in both compartments.

PcG proteins play a role in determining cell fate during both normal and pathologic processes. Two separate subsets of PcG complexes PRC1 and PRC2 have been described in humans. PRC1 may be involved in maintenance of repression whereas PRC2 plays a role in initiating repression. The PRC2 complex includes the EZH2 EED and SUZ proteins. Altered expression of these proteins has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Increased EZH2 levels have been related to cancer cell proliferation and invasion. However prior to the disclosed work the role of EZH2 in angiogenesis was not known.

Angiogenesis is regulated by the balance of various pro angiogenic stimulators such as VEGF and several angiogenesis inhibitors such as angiostatin endostatin and antithrombin. On the basis of findings from genomic profiling of endothelial cells from ovarian cancer versus those from normal ovaries it was discovered that EZH2 expression is significantly increased in tumor associated endothelial cells. VEGF is well recognized as a pro angiogenic factor in ovarian and other cancers. In the current study it was shown for the first time that VEGF can directly increase EZH2 levels in endothelial cells which in turn inactivating a potent anti angiogenic factor VASH1 via methylating VASH1 gene and H3K27. Silencing EZH2 gene resulted in demethylation of VASH1 gene and H3K27 in endothelial cells which is consistent with other report indicating EZH2 directly controls DNA methylation of EZH2 targeted genes concomitant with reducing H3K27. Therefore through this study a novel mechanism by which tumor angiogenesis is regulated was discovered and a rationale for pursuing EZH2 as a therapeutic target was provided.

While a number of attractive targets in tumor and endothelial cells have been identified many of these are difficult to target with small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Therefore RNA interference was employed as a means to target EZH2. Due to limited delivery of siRNA into the tumor associated endothelial cells with this approach additional nanoparticles were developed that would allow siRNA delivery into both tumor and tumor associated endothelial cells. Chitosan CH is a naturally occurring polysaccharide with low immunogenicity and low toxicity. Here CH was used because of its advantageous biological properties such as biodegradability biocompatibility and slight positive charge. These properties make use of CH for systemic in vivo siRNA delivery highly attractive. Indeed the disclosed data demonstrate highly efficient delivery of siRNA incorporated into CH nanoparticles into both tumor and tumor associated endothelial cells. Therefore the present work provides an attractive method for systemic delivery of siRNA that could be developed for clinical applications.

Molecular and genetic manipulations have identified EZH2 as a key regulator of tumor angiogenesis here but these effects do not rule out the possibility that EZH2 has oncogenic functions in the tumor cells. For example EZH2 has been implicated in cellular transformation proliferation and avoidance of apoptosis. Such results imply that multiple signaling pathways likely convey the net effects of EZH2 in promoting tumor growth. However to the extent that targeting tumor endothelial cells provides therapeutic benefit interfering with EZH2 in the tumor and endothelial cells represents a novel strategy for treatment of ovarian and other cancers.

In summary these studies illustrate that increased EZH2 expression in either tumor cells or in tumor vasculature is predictive of poor clinical outcome. The increase in endothelial EZH2 is a direct result of VEGF stimulation and indicates the presence of a paracrine circuit that promotes angiogenesis by methylating histone H3 lysine 27 and silencing VASH1 EZH2 silencing in tumor cells and in the tumor associated endothelial cells resulted in inhibition of angiogenesis and ovarian cancer growth. The anti angiogenic effect was mediated by reactivating VASH1. Thus these data support the potential for targeting EZH2 as a novel therapeutic approach

According to the teachings herein one or more agents for the use of treating an ovarian tumor such as ovarian cancer can be identified by contacting an ovarian tumor endothelial cell with one or more test agents under conditions sufficient for the one or more test agents to alter the activity of at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule listed in Tables 1 2 3 4 or 5. The method also includes detecting the activity of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the presence and absence of the one or more test agents. The activity of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in the presence of the one or more test agents is then compared to the activity in the absence of such agents to determine if there is differential expression of the at least one ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule. Differential expression of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule indicates that the one or more test agents is of use to treat the ovarian tumor. For example a test agent that reduces or inhibits the activity or expression of an ovarian endothelial tumor associated molecule that is upregulated in ovarian tumor endothelial cells indicates that the test agent is of use to treat the ovarian tumor. Differential expression can be detected at the nucleic acid or protein level. An RNA expression product can be detected by a microarray or PCR by methods described above see for example Example 1 . A protein expression product can be detected by standard Western blot or immunoassay techniques that are known to one of skill in the art. However the disclosure is not limited to particular methods of detection.

This example describes methods that can be used to identify ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule inhibitors that can be used to target specific genes involved in ovarian tumor growth and or vascularization.

Based upon the teaching disclosed herein iSynthetic siRNA molecules are generated against selected target genes such as any of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated up regulated genes identified in Examples 2 through 5. In an example the siRNA molecules are obtained from commercial sources. Knockdown efficiency of the siRNA molecules is assessed as indicated in Example 1. In an example a significant knockdown efficiency is approximately 20 . As provided in Example 1 the effects of target gene siRNA s on tumor growth and vascularization can be determined by evaluating the effect of siRNA treatment on cell migration and tube formation in HUVECs.

In additional examples cells are treated with two or more siRNAs that target two or more genes . The ICvalues are compared between target gene siRNA individually and in combination to determine whether the knockdown effect on tumor growth and vascularization is cumulative or additive. siRNAs that reduce or decrease by approximately 20 the activity or expression of the targeted ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule which is upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells are selected for further study.

Based upon the teachings disclosed herein the effectiveness of an ovarian tumor treatment can be evaluated by determining the effectiveness of an agent for the treatment of an ovarian tumor in a subject with the ovarian tumor. In an example the method includes detecting expression of an ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule in a sample from the subject following treatment with the agent. The expression of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule following treatment is compared to a control a non cancerous ovarian endothelial cell . A reduction or inhibition of the expression or biological activity of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecule which is upregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells following treatment indicates that the agent is effective for the treatment of an ovarian cancer in the subject. Alternatively an increase in the expression or biological activity of an ovarian endothelial tumor associated molecule that is downregulated in ovarian endothelial tumor cells following treatment indicates that the agent is effective for the treatment of the ovarian cancer in the subject. In a specific example the method includes detecting and comparing the protein expression levels of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules. In other examples the method includes detecting and comparing the mRNA expression levels of the ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules.

This example describes methods that can be used to significantly reduce ovarian tumor growth vascularization in a subject with ovarian cancer.

Based upon the teachings disclosed herein an ovarian tumor such as ovarian cancer can be treated by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a composition wherein the composition comprises a specific binding agent that preferentially binds to one or more ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules provided in Tables 1 through 5 thereby inhibiting tumor growth and or vascularization.

In an example a subject who has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer is identified. In some examples gene expression is screened to determine which genes are to be targeted. Following subject selection a therapeutic effective dose of the composition including the specific binding agent is administered to the subject. For example a therapeutic effective dose of a specific binding agent to one or more of the disclosed ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules is administered to the subject to reduce or inhibit tumor growth and or vascularization. In an example the specific binding agent is a siRNA. In another example the specific binding agent is an antibody. In a further example the specific binding agent is conjugated to a therapeutic agent such as a cytotoxin chemotherapeutic reagent radionucleotide or a combination thereof.

The amount of the composition administered to prevent reduce inhibit and or treat ovarian cancer or a condition associated with it depends on the subject being treated the severity of the disorder and the manner of administration of the therapeutic composition. Ideally a therapeutically effective amount of an agent is the amount sufficient to prevent reduce and or inhibit and or treat the condition e.g. ovarian cancer in a subject without causing a substantial cytotoxic effect in the subject.

In one specific example siRNAs are incorporated into the neutral liposome DOPC and injected intraperitoneal or intravenously at 150 g kg twice weekly for 2 to 3 weeks.

In another specific example naked antibodies are administered at 5 mg per kg every two weeks or 10 mg per kg every two weeks depending upon the stage of the ovarian cancer. In an example the antibodies are administered continuously. In another example antibodies or antibody fragments conjugated to cytotoxic agents immunotoxins are administered at 50 g per kg given twice a week for 2 to 3 weeks.

This example describes particular methods that can be used to diagnose or prognose a metastatic ovarian tumor in a subject such as metastatic ovarian cancer in a human. However one skilled in the art will appreciate that similar methods can be used. In some examples such diagnosis is performed before treating the subject for example as described in Example 11 .

Biological samples are obtained from the subject. If blood or a fraction thereof such as serum is used 1 100 l of blood is collected. Serum can either be used directly or fractionated using filter cut offs to remove high molecular weight proteins. If desired the serum can be frozen and thawed before use. If a tissue biopsy sample is used 1 100 g of tissue is obtained for example using a fine needle aspirate RNA or protein is isolated from the tissue using routine methods for example using a commercial kit .

In one example pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated nucleic acid expression levels such as nucleic acid expression levels of EZH2 are determined in a tumor sample obtained from the subject by microarray analysis or real time quantitative PCR. In an example the disclosed gene profile is utilized. In other examples the amount of such molecules is determined at the protein level by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as Western blot or immunoassay techniques. The relative amount of pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules are compared to a reference value such as a relative amount of such molecules present in a non tumor sample from wherein the presence of significantly greater amounts of pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated molecules listed in Tables 1 2 4 and 5 and indicated to be involved in angiogenesis in the tumor sample as compared to the non tumor sample such as an increase of at least 2 fold at least 3 fold or at least 5 fold indicates that the subject has a metastatic ovarian tumor has an increased likelihood of an ovarian tumor metastasizing has a poor prognosis or combinations thereof. In other examples a decrease in expression of those molecules listed in Table 3 and involved in angiogenesis indicates that the subject has a metastatic ovarian tumor has an increased likelihood of an ovarian tumor metastasizing has a poor prognosis or combinations thereof. In some examples relative amount of pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated proteins and pro angiogenic ovarian endothelial cell tumor associated mRNA expression are determined in the same subject using the methods described above.
