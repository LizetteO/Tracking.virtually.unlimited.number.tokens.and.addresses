title: Location updates for a distributed data store
abstract: Version indicators within an existing range can be associated with a data partition in a distributed data store. A partition reconfiguration can be associated with one of multiple partitions in the data store, and a new version indicator that is outside the existing range can be assigned to the reconfigured partition. Additionally, a broadcast message can be sent to multiple nodes, which can include storage nodes and/or client nodes that are configured to communicate with storage nodes to access data in a distributed data store. The broadcast message can include updated location information for data in the data store. In addition, a response message can be sent to a requesting node of the multiple nodes in response to receiving from that node a message that requests updated location information for the data. The response message can include the requested updated location information.
