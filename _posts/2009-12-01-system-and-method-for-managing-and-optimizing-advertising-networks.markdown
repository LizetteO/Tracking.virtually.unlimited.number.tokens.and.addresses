The present patent application claims the benefits of priority of commonly assigned Canadian Patent Application no. 2 659 538 entitled System and Method for Managing and Optimizing Advertising Networks and filed at the Canadian Patent Office on Mar. 30 2009.

Pay per click advertising permits advertisers to create online advertisements and to bid on keywords they believe are relevant to their target market. When a search query is received that includes the keywords the advertisement is displayed along with relevant search results for the keywords. The on screen position of the advertisement depends upon the maximum bid amount specified by the advertiser. Higher bids typically result in better placement of the advertisement. The advertiser only pays if a user clicks on the advertisement.

While pay per click advertising has become extremely popular it remains difficult for an individual or small business to set up an advertising campaign. Writing content for an advertisement selecting keywords setting a budget and bidding on terms can be a complicated time consuming process that must be repeated for each search engine advertising network at which the advertisement is placed.

Once an advertising campaign has been created an advertiser must often spend a considerable amount of time determining the keywords that are generating the most referrals from each search engine and replacing low performing keywords with new terms. This also can be a difficult and time consuming process especially if the advertisement is placed on multiple search engine advertising networks. Because the software tools for performing these functions are advertising network specific advertisers are generally required to master multiple tools or to limit their advertising to only one search engine.

With the advent of the Internet online advertising has become widely popular and commonly used among various businesses. In addition to being cost effective and far reaching it allows businesses to get more information to potential users than more traditional forms of advertising such as publications and media campaigns. Generally online advertising includes search engine desktop email advertising as well as various other forms. Web based advertising systems are typically measured using certain metrics at different stages of the advertisement presentment and fulfillment process. For example the number of times an advertisement is shown in measures and typically denoted impressions. Impressions have been based on keywords or content that appears on a site. A click on an advertisement is typically measured as a clickthrus. The advertisement copy typically drives the number of clickthrus. When a viewer takes a desired action on the web site of the advertiser that is often referred to as a conversion. Desired actions typically include sign up completion of a survey and a sale. The cost associated with ads is tracked as costs and sales as sales.

A multitude of techniques has been developed for measuring the success of advertising campaigns online based on various metrics. These practices often involve determinations of how often users tend to perform desired actions in comparison to costs and various other factors involved. However these systems generally lack an effective and user friendly approach to analyzing visualizing and improving online advertising systems. Accordingly a need exists for a more efficient way to measure and improve such systems. Further a need exists for an effective user friendly interface for online advertising systems.

The system and method of the present invention combine data at least from Google Adwords Yahoo Search Marketing and Microsoft adCenter into a white label application. It is to be understood that data from other company or system could be combined.

The system fills the need for a comprehensive management optimization and reporting tool for agencies with features like 

The system of the present invention is particularly suited for agencies. A tool designed for agencies needs to allow for management at the client level as well as the agency level. The system client center gives each member of the team a summary view of the client accounts that they re responsible for along with emerging trend indicators for every major metric.

The system provides at a glance monitoring of trends at the agency account campaign ad group and keyword level offers an invaluable birds eye view to every level of the team from account managers to executives.

With the system the SEM department only needs to learn one simple interface in order to effectively manage and report on multiple campaigns at many different providers dramatically increasing productivity and letting your team concentrate on strategy and optimization.

The system of the present invention is used to execute data consolidation to combine data from Google MSN and Yahoo at least. The user does not need anymore to combine by himself data in spreadsheets. The system allows creating consolidated campaigns that span across search providers letting the user effortlessly build reports that previously took hours to create each month.

The system is designed for interactive advertising agencies it is built from the ground up exclusively for interactive advertising agencies. The data are integrated from Google Adwords Yahoo Search Marketing and Microsoft Adcenter at least into one easy to use management and reporting tool designed specifically to save money while improving the firm s performance.

The system is the first software of its kind to offer comprehensive PPC campaign account and even agency level management. The concept of what bid management software is and should be has evolved tremendously over the past few years. The main cause of change stem from two facts 

It used to be as simple as viewing the bids around you and finding the gap which allowed you to be in the most desirable position for the least amount of money. Identifying and shifting bids to constantly take advantage of these gaps was the primary purpose of PPC bid management software up until 2003.

PPC Software has had to evolve along with search provider changes. What you bid is no longer the only variable which determines your positioning but simply one of a handful of important aspects. Effective campaign management requires having an eagle eye on your metrics over time and being able to make changes across ad copy bids landing page copy and other pertinent variables quickly and efficiently.

It is this evolution in mind that drives the development of the system. In addition to powerful tools to help identify weak spots in your campaigns by examining your performance history we provide an editor much like Google Adwords editor which allows you to manage all of your Google Yahoo Search Marketing and Microsoft AdCenter accounts from the same place.

Our trends bar helps you keep track of your metrics with ease giving continuous feedback on how every variable compares with a previous time frame. If your spend is 7 higher this week than last this information will be pushed to you as soon as you view your account no calculators or time consuming work needed.

If you ve ever spent hours pouring over pay per click campaign data in order to try and optimize a client account you know how frustrating it can be not knowing what the potential results of your efforts may be.

Take the stress and worry out of pay per click optimization with the system optimizer a new module included as part of the system which allows for a number of approaches to PPC campaign optimization.

The system PPC campaign optimizer is designed to help you intuitively craft the style of campaign that you want. With the ability to minimize or maximize one of your campaign metrics and then choose the maintenance levels of the remaining variables the system campaign optimizer gives you the opportunity to easily see the predicted effects of your changes. PPC campaign optimization differs for the style of advertiser you re managing and now campaign specific optimization has been made easy for you for all of your clients.

We study your historical account data to determine which of your keywords are underperforming. Reallocation of this portion of spend can reduce the campaign CPA while maintaining your chosen percentage of conversions clicks and impressions.

Is your advertising client looking for more brand exposure Branding campaigns require maximum impressions and achieving this is as simple as choosing to maximize your impressions within the optimization module remember that within the Google Adwords system keywords need to maintain a healthy number of clicks as you don t want your quality score to suffer because of a lower click through rate.

Perhaps your client is very CPA focused. If you choose to minimize your cost while maintaining your conversions you can reduce CPA without compromising the sales they are currently making from the most effective keywords in the campaign.

If instead your client simply wants the most traffic possible with the least cost simply choose to maximize clicks and then drag the cost slider down until you ve found the perfect optimization.

PPC Report automation is one of the cornerstone features of the system. When we set out to make a PPC management tool designed to help agencies and those who manage more than a single campaign we knew that reporting was one of the most time consuming tasks that goes into effective management for clients.

The complexities that arise out of advertising campaigns which are split across multiple search providers can often slow the process of report building to a crawl. Gathering cost impression click and conversion data from each provider importing it into spreadsheets hammering out formula to combine the data in meaningful ways creating tables graphs and charts to represent that meaning and then finally commenting on each element and producing a flawless PDF all together it s a lot of work that even the most seasoned PPC veteran can consider overwhelming.

Imagine a PPC reporting tool that eliminates all of the grunt work from the above task list. With the system Report Center all you have to do is add the elements you wish to see in your report write a few comments and hit the publish button. In a typical advertising agency month end reporting situation we have found time dedicated to producing reports may be cut more than 90 .

The system aggregates data from across all of the major PPC providers in the way that you choose. This in combination with our integrated report building tool allows for quick report production right from within the System interface producing beautiful client ready PDF files instantly.

The system built in What You See is What You Get WYSIWIG report builder allows almost any chart data grid or graph can be quickly added to the pay per click report you re building on the fly. Simply add the elements you wish to see in the report then switch to the WYSIWYG reporting tool drag and drop elements to find the perfect format add some comments where you see fit and you re done.

Within the present document a platform allowing the bidding and buying of pay per click advertisement such as Google Adwords Yahoo Search Marketing or Bing Ads is referred as an advertising provider or advertising platform. Such an advertising provider allows an agency or any user to create one or more advertising campaigns.

The features of the present invention which are believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claims.

A novel system and method for managing and optimizing advertising networks will be described hereinafter. Although the invention is described in terms of specific illustrative embodiment s it is to be understood that the embodiment s described herein are by way of example only and that the scope of the invention is not intended to be limited thereby.

The system and method in accordance with the present invention allows the management and the optimization of the metrics of one or more pay per click advertising campaign where advertisement are bought on one or more advertising provider. As an example an advertiser may optimize during a single operation the buying of advertisement on a plurality of advertising platforms such as Google AdWords Yahoo Search Marketing Bing Ads in a way to maintain the cost as low as possible or to increase the conversion rate. Thus in the present example an advertiser benefits from having access to consolidated reports of the advertising campaign on a plurality of advertising platforms.

It s no secret that PPC managers have been craving a tool to help with mass editing of bids creative URLs and other campaign elements for years now. Ever since the release of Google s own tool and understanding the potential of the management style the desire has been to see a piece of software which spans multiple providers more than just Google.

Do you need to update the ad copy now that a promo is over There is no quicker way than logging into System searching for a part of the ad copy text replacing the copy and posting changes.

In addition to daily management tasks we wanted to create a tool that simplifies the work involved with launching campaigns and adgroups across multiple providers. We use the Google Adwords API which has a strict terms and conditions when it comes to sharing Google data with other providers. So while we cannot make copying an ad group or campaign from Google to Yahoo a drag and drop process we can simplify things down to a few clicks and a copy and paste.

Campaign Selector Specs Module Mass Editor In order to support the edition of large search engine account more than 30k 40k keywords it is suggested to offer to users the ability to pick the ppc campaigns they want to see in the mass editor instead of loading all campaigns at all time.

The system allows the user to manage and report a plurality of providers for example Google Adwords Yahoo Search Marketing Panama edition and Microsoft AdCenter and it offers the ability to customize how the user combine data from each creating his own consolidated campaign containers which can include data from all chosen providers. This allows the user to present campaign data in the way that his client sees their own campaigns independent of search provider. It also greatly simplifies the process of reporting as the user no longer have to combine data from each search network manually.

As shown in the system makes it easy to provide each member of the marketing department with secure customized access to the individual client accounts that they re responsible for. The account managers or clients can each be issued access to individual or sets of PPC accounts within the system.
