title: Systems and methods for message based determination of printer capabilities
abstract: Methods disclosed facilitate the identification of printers from among a plurality of network accessible printers based on information about at least one printer sub-state using commonly available messaging techniques such as e-mail. In some embodiments, an email message, which includes queries with search criteria pertaining to the at least one printer sub-state, is received and a sub-state database is queried based on the search criteria pertaining to the printer sub-state to obtain a set of printers that satisfy the search criteria. The sub-state database comprises information that correlates printer identification information with corresponding printer sub-state information of the plurality of network accessible printers. The response to the query is used to respond to the e-mail request with the e-mail response including identification information about printers in the set of printers that satisfy the search criteria.
