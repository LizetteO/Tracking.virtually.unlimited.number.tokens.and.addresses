Embodiments herein relate to the field of chemistry and more specifically to novel luminescent compounds synthesis thereof and methods of using same.

Squaraine dyes are organic dyes with very intense fluorescence spectra typically in the red and near infrared region which makes them attractive for biological applications. They are characterized by an aromatic four membered ring system derived from squaric acid.

Some squaraine dyes may be conjugated to biomolecules through a free carboxylic acid group. However these lipophilic squaraine dyes suffer from three problems in physiological solutions poor solubility massive aggregation induced loss of fluorescence signal and poor stability. Even sulfonated squaraine derivatives that are water soluble are still unstable in PBS.

Most squaraines are encumbered by nucleophilic attack of the central four membered ring which is highly electron deficient. This encumbrance may be attenuated by trapping the squaraine inside a macrocycle to form a permanently interlocked molecule called a squaraine rotaxane. Formation of a rotaxane around the dye helps to protect it from nucleophiles which improves the stability of squaraine dyes in physiological solutions like phosphate buffered saline PBS . However squaraine rotaxanes still lose fluorescence signal under very strong aggregation conditions such as phosphate buffered saline which limits their usefulness in biological applications.

As used herein the term zwitterionic group refers to a group that has both a positive charge and a negative charge when the molecule is in an environment that is close to neutral pH. A molecule may have several attached zwitterionic groups Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a new family of squaraine rotaxane dyes that solve all major problems that known squaraine rotaxanes exhibit in physiological solutions including poor solubility aggregation induced loss of fluorescence signal poor stability only moderate brightness poor biodistribution in animals or bioconjugates with greatly altered charge patterns. The novel squaraine rotaxane dyes have photophysical properties that are very similar to the commonly used Cy 5 fluorophore however the new dyes are substantially more photostable and they resist quenching. This makes them superior substitutes for Cy 5 in many biotechnological and imaging applications. In some embodiments the dyes may be conjugated to small and large biological molecules to make fluorescent molecular probes for various imaging applications.

In some embodiments the squaraine rotaxanes may include one or more sulfonate or phosphonate groups and also may include one or more reactive sites for bioconjugation. In other embodiments the squaraine rotaxanes may be uncharged or nearly uncharged overall but may include one or more zwitterionic groups for water solubility and also may include one or more reactive sites for bioconjugation. Embodiments of the present disclosure encompass any racemic optically active polymorphic tautomeric or stereoisomeric form or mixture thereof of a compound of the disclosure that possesses the useful properties described herein. Other embodiments include bioconjugates of the squaraine rotaxane dyes disclosed herein. Still other embodiments provide methods of synthesizing the squaraine rotaxane compounds described herein.

In embodiments squaraine rotaxanes are made in three major steps 1 fabrication of the central squaraine thread component 2 encapsulation of this thread component inside a macrocycle to make a rotaxane and 3 covalent modification of the rotaxane. As described herein sulfonate phosphonate or zwitterionic groups are added after the second step since their presence diminishes the synthetic yields in the second step. Reactions that directly attach sulfonate groups via electrophilic addition mechanisms do not produce high yields of products. Embodiments disclose herein a much better approach for attaching a sulfonate or a phosphate group or a zwitterionic group to the squaraine rotaxane.

In some embodiments attaching a sulfonate phosphonate or zwitterionic group to the squaraine rotaxane via amide bond formation is undesirable for bioimaging probes because amide bonds may be broken by enzymatic action. Preferred embodiments involve the conjugation method of forming triazole linkages using a copper catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition reaction. In embodiments triazoles are excellent linkages because they are resistant to protease enzyme cleavage and their formation does not produce by products.

In an embodiment a squaraine rotaxane may have at least one sulfonate phosphonate group and or at least one zwitterionic group and may have the formula 

In embodiments the exemplary compounds described above may be synthesized according to the following general procedures. In some embodiments symmetrical squaraine dyes are prepared in one step by heating two equivalents of the appropriate aniline derivative with squaric acid. In other embodiments unsymmetrical squaraines are prepared in two steps via a stable semi squaraine intermediate see e.g. .

In some embodiments a subsequent template macrocyclization step yields a squaraine rotaxane dye as shown in the example below using an aniline based squaraine.

It was not known prior to the present disclosure that this procedure may be used to prepare aniline based squaraine rotaxanes with ortho hydroxyl groups on the aniline rings such as the following example.

The product of this reaction has the following spectral data. H NMR 0.96 t J 7.4 Hz 12H 1.30 dd J 7.4 Hz 7.0 Hz 8H 1.52 br s 8H 3.22 t J 6.6 Hz 8H 3.93 d J 14.0 Hz 4H 5.08 m 6H 5.98 d J 2.0 Hz 2H 6.73 d J 9.0 Hz 4H 6.93 d J 9.0 Hz 4H 7.73 d J 9.2 Hz 2H 8.1 t J 8.0 Hz 2H 8.50 d J 7.8 Hz 4H 9.88 d J 8.8 Hz 4H 11.2 s 2H Abs 651 nm Em 672 nm.

Aniline based squaraine rotaxanes with ortho hydroxyl groups are a novel set of squaraine rotaxanes that exhibit highly favorable chemical and photophysical performance due in part to the hydrogen bonding between the ortho hydroxyl groups and the squaraine oxygens which provides structural rigidity and blocks chemical attack. Another favorable attribute gained by the presence of ortho hydroxyl groups is reduced fluorescence quenching by water. This may be demonstrated by comparing compound 1 which has no ortho hydroxyls attached to the anilines with compound 2 which has two ortho hydroxyls attached to one of the anilines. Photophysical measurements in two solvents tetrahydrofuran THF and THF water 1 1 show that the fluorescence quantum yield of compound 1 decreases by 33 when the solvent is changed from THF to THF Water 1 1 . This is due to the squaraine quenching effect of water. In contrast the fluorescence quantum yield of compound 2 is not altered when the solvent is changed from THF to THF water 1 1 . This demonstrates that the fluorescence brightness of squaraine rotaxanes with ortho hydroxyl groups is insensitive to solvent and local environment a valuable property in quantitative imaging and sensing technologies.

With anthracene containing macrocycles a new class of squaraine rotaxane dyes may be formed by a slippage process that involves mixing the squaraine and the macrocycle components and using heat or microwave radiation to induce the squaraine dye to slip inside the macrocycle to form a squaraine rotaxane intermediate that may be further modified. One embodiment of this synthesis is as follows.

The product of this reaction has the following spectral data. H NMR 600 MHz CDCl 0.89 m 6H 1.07 t J 7.8 Hz 3H 1.20 m 4H 1.46 m 4H 1.71 m 2H 3.42 m 8H 6.53 d J 9.0 Hz 2H 6.61 d J 9.0 Hz 2H 6.72 d J 9.0 Hz 1H 6.83 d J 8.4 Hz 1H 7.35 m 8H 6.94 d J 8.4 Hz 1H 7.76 d J 9.0 Hz 4H 7.82 d J 9.0 Hz 4H 8.67 d J 7.8 Hz 4H 8.22 dd J 7.8 4.2 Hz 2H 9.76 t J 4.8 Hz 4H 11.25 s 1H 5.37 d J 10 Hz 8H Abs 653 nm Em 703 nm.

Exemplary squaraine rotaxanes with one or more sulfonate or zwitterionic groups attached and one or more reactive sites for bioconjugation were generated and tested. Efficient and effective methods for attaching sulfonate groups or zwitterionic groups to squaraine rotaxanes were not known prior to the present disclosure. In embodiments the squaraine rotaxane may be modified and groups may be introduced that provide water solubility and reactivity using the conjugation method of forming triazole linkages using a copper catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition reaction as shown in the following exemplary reaction.

It was not known prior to the present disclosure that particular modifications prevent aggregation of the squaraine rotaxanes in physiological fluids such as phosphate buffered saline PBS . shows an exemplary absorption spectrum of unmodified lipophilic squaraine rotaxane 3 in a DMSO PBS solvent mixture that promotes aggregation. Aggregates that exhibit the absorption band at 573 nm are not fluorescent.

In some embodiments the squaraine rotaxanes are water soluble but overall uncharged because they have one or more attached polyethylene glycol or zwitterionic groups for water solubility and one or more reactive sites for bioconjugation. The attachment of a dye with many anionic or cationic groups to a biological molecule sometimes changes the charge pattern of the biological molecule to such an extent that its chemical biochemical or supramolecular properties are altered adversely. In another embodiment the attachment of a dye having many anionic groups or many cationic groups to a biological molecule produces a bioconjugate that when introduced into an animal is not likely to be cleared primarily from the bloodstream by the kidney which complicates imaging performance. These problems are solved in embodiments by creating squaraine rotaxanes with one or more polyethyleneglycol or zwitterionic groups for water solubility and one or more reactive sites for bioconjugation. In embodiments the overall net charge of these compounds is zero or close to zero. In embodiments these compounds have excellent water solubility and excellent stability do not form non fluorescent aggregates in PBS and have a greater tendency to clear from the bloodstream of animals through the kidney.

Surprisingly in embodiments squaraine rotaxanes with one or more attached sulfonates or attached zwitterionic groups are very photostable even when they are associated with proteins that normally quench other dyes. The following exemplary probe molecule biotin squaraine rotaxane SQR biotin was synthesized 

In one specific non limiting example the photobleaching of commercially available biotin 4 carboxyfluorescein CF biotin and biotin squaraine rotaxane SQR biotin was examined by measuring the half life of each of the probes. The dyes were incubated in excess with 1.3 m magnetic particles coated in avidin. Following the incubation the particles were washed of any unbound fluorophore and the samples were then imaged on an epifluorescent microscope. The samples remained under constant excitation and images were captured every 30 seconds. Using ImageJ software a region of interest ROI was drawn around the imaged magnetic particles and the mean pixel intensity was measured for each image. These data were then plotted versus time and the half life was calculated. shows the photobleaching profile of the two biotinylated fluorophores. The biotin 4 carboxyfluorescein probe showed dramatic photobleaching but the biotin squaraine rotaxane probe retained fluorescence intensity throughout the duration of the test.

Anti rabbit IgG antibodies 2 mg mL in sodium bicarbonate buffer 0.1 M pH 8.3 are labeled by adding an aliquot of squaraine rotaxane N hydroxysuccinimde ester 50 mM stock in DSMO to a give a final concentration of 5 mg mL and incubating for one hour at 37 C. in the dark. Unconjugated dye is separated from the labeled protein by size exclusion chromatography using 30 000 MW resin and sodium phosphate buffer 50 mM pH 7.3 as eluent. The dye protein ratio is determined spectrometrically from the molar absorptivity of 180 000 cmMfor the dye at 640 nm and 203 000 cmMfor the antibody at 280 nm this includes the contribution from attached dye .

Fluorescent dyes are often used to covalently label oligonucleotides especially DNA and allow detection assays for various applications in biotechnology medicine public health and national security.

Oligonucleotide 2 mg mL is desalted with a NAP 5 column and placed in sodium bicarbonate buffer 0.1 M pH 8.3 . Labeling is achieved by adding an aliquot of squaraine rotaxane N hydroxysuccinimde ester 50 mM stock in DSMO to a give a final concentration of 5 mg mL and incubating for one hour at 37 C. in the dark. Unconjugated dye was separated from the oligonucleotide by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephadex 25 column followed by ethanol precipitation and the labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotides are separated by gel electrophoresis. The bands containing the labeled oligonucleotide are identified and excised. The oligonucleotide is extracted using 10 mM tris HCl and then purified by extraction with phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol ethanol precipitation and desalting with a NAP 5 column.
