Telangiectasias are highly prevalent skin disorders. Telangiectasias are visible small red purple or blue surface blood vessels that can be located on the face upper chest neck or other parts of the body. Telangiectatic blood vessels which can include swollen blood vessels spider veins red dermal patches purple dermal patches or blue dermal patches are abnormal and are not necessary for any essential body function.

Telangiectatic blood vessels can appear with or without a preceding or concurrent skin or internal disease. Telangiectasias can develop anywhere within the body but can be most easily seen in the skin. Telangiectasias include essential or primary telangiectasias which include blood vessel dilations of unknown etiology. Generalized essential telangiectasias GET exhibit a widespread distribution pattern over the body. Other primary telangiectases include angioma serpiginosum ataxia telangiectasia angiomas and spider naevi. Some other examples of conditions syndromes diseases and disorders which can include telangiectasias are CREST Syndrome acronym for Calcinosis Raynaud s phenomenon Esophageal dysfunction Sclerodactyl and Telangiextasis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia Osler Weber Rendu Syndrome Ataxia telangiectasia rosacea also known as acne rosacea basal cell carcinoma scleroderma unilateral nevoid telangiectasia Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

A telangiectasia can be a symptom of rosacea However rosacea also encompasses erythema and is accordingly a phenomenon distinct from a telangiectasia.

Current treatments for ameliorating telangiectasias include laser therapy and electro optical synergy ELOS which combines intense pulsed optical energy and conducted bipolar radiofrequency RF energy into a single pulse Sadick N S et al. J. Drugs Dermatolog. 4 181 186 2005 .

No. 3 890 319 issued Jun. 17 1975 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 029 792 issued Jun. 14 1977 both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Scheme 1 below illustrates one method to synthesize compounds of Formula I.

Compounds of the present teachings can be synthesized by reaction of the appropriate quinoxalines 15 with thiophosgene 20 to form corresponding isothiocyanates 25. The reaction with thiophosgene can be carried out in aqueous solution or in dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid at room temperature in a period of about 2 hours. Alternatively the thiophosgene 20 dissolved in a water immiscible solvent such as chloroform can be added to a basic aqueous solution sodium carbonate of quinoxalines 15 and stirred for about two hours. In the first alternative isothiocyanates 25 precipitate from the reaction mixture. Precipitation can be completed by neutralization with excess aqueous base. Precipitated isothiocyanates 25 can be recovered by filtration and dissolved in a suitable solvent e.g. chloroform to form a solution. The solution can be dried e.g. over MgS0 filtered and concentrated to yield the isothiocyanates 25.

Isothiocyanates 25 can be treated with an excess of the appropriately substituted ethylene diamine to form the corresponding 3 quinoxalin 6 yl thioureas 35. Isothiocyanates 25 can be reacted with an excess e.g. 5 moles to 1 mole of ethylene diamine 30 in a suitable solvent e.g. diethyl ether benzene chloroform or dioxane. The reaction can be carried out at room temperature for about 2 hours. 3 Quinoxalin 6 yl thioureas 35 precipitate and can be recovered by filtration and washing the filter cake with solvent.

Cyclization of 3 quinoxalin 6 yl thioureas 35 to afford compounds of the present teachings 10 can be effected by heating a suspension of thioureas 35 with mercuric or cupric oxide in a suitable organic solvent e.g. ethanol. The mercuric or cupric oxide can be replaced by an organic soluble mercuric or cupric salt e.g. mercuric or cupric acetate. The reaction mixture can be filtered to remove the mercuric or cupric sulfide by product and the filtrate can be concentrated to give compounds 10 in crude form. Compounds 10 can be recrystallized as the free base or converted to an acid addition salt by conventional reaction with a suitable acid. In certain cases cyclization can be effected by simply refluxing the thioureas 35 in a suitable organic solvent e.g. methanol in the absence of mercuric or cupric oxide.

This example illustrates treatment of a telagiectasia of a subject by topical application of an adrenergic receptor agonist.

In this example a 59 year old woman with facial telangiectasias cleanses her face using ordinary soap and water cleaning. After toweling her face dry and further air drying she uses a cotton swab to apply topically Alphagan P Allergan 0.15 brimonidine tartrate in isotonic saline and citrate buffer pH 6.3 6.5 directly to the telangiectatic skin. As observed without magnification the telangiectasias in the swabbed area begin to fade in visibility within about 15 minutes after application of the Alphagan P and become nearly entirely faded within about 30 minutes. The telangiectasias remain faded for about 18 hr.
