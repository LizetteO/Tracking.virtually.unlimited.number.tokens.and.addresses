Computers have become increasingly interconnected via networks such as the Internet and security and authentication concerns have become increasingly important. Cryptographic techniques that involve a key based cipher for example can take sequences of intelligible data e.g. typically referred to as plaintext that form a message and mathematically transform them into seemingly unintelligible data e.g. typically referred to as ciphertext through and enciphering process. In this example the enciphering can be reversed thereby allowing recipients of the ciphertext with an appropriate key to transform the ciphertext back to plaintext while making it very difficult if not nearly impossible for those without the appropriate key from recovering the plaintext.

Public key cryptographic techniques are an embodiment of key based cipher. In public key cryptography for example respective communicating parties have a public private key pair. The public key of the respective pairs is made publicly available e.g. or at least available to others who are intended to send encrypted communications and the private key is kept secret. In order to communicate a plaintext message using encryption to a receiving party for example an originating party can encrypt the plaintext message into a ciphertext message using the public key of the receiving party and communicate the ciphertext message to the receiving party. In this example upon receipt of the ciphertext message the receiving party can decrypt the message using its secret private key thereby recovering the original plaintext message.

An example of public private key cryptology comprises generating two large prime numbers and multiplying them together to get a large composite number which is made public. In this example if the primes are properly chosen and large enough it may be extremely difficult e.g. practically impossible due to computational infeasibility for someone who does not know the primes to determine them from just knowing the composite number. However in order to be secure the size of the composite number should be more than 1 000 bits. In some situations such a large size makes impractical to be used.

An example of authentication is where a party or a machine attempts to prove that it is authorized to access or use a product or service. Often a product ID system is utilized for a software program s where a user enters a product ID sequence stamped on the outside of the properly licensed software package as proof that the software has been properly paid for. If the product ID sequence is too long then it will be cumbersome and user unfriendly. Other common examples include user authentication when a user identifies themselves to a computer system using an authentication code.

As another example in cryptography elliptic curves are often used to generate cryptographic keys. An elliptic curve is a mathematical object that has a structure and properties well suited for cryptography. Many protocols for elliptic curves have already been standardized for use in cryptography. Further genus 2 curves can be used with cryptography however unlike the case of elliptic curves which are genus 1 curves protocols for these genus 2 curves have not been standardized.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Encryption and decryption are usually performed based on a secret. This secret is often an order of a group of points. A variety of different curves can be used and in one implementation the curve is a genus 2 curve. A group of elements e.g. points derived from a genus 2 curve can be used in the encryption decryption for example as a discrete logarithm problem DLP for such a group is considered to be hard or difficult to solve. A hard DLP is preferred in cryptology in order to create a more secure encryption decryption process for example.

Currently when constructing a genus 2 curve for cryptographic purposes three auxiliary polynomials with rational coefficients are typically computed. These polynomials are usually Igusa class polynomials and the roots are often referred to as invariants where three Igusa invariants can be used to construct a genus 2 curve for example. Presently computation of Igusa class polynomials is very difficult and computationally expensive.

One or more of the techniques and or systems described herein provide an alternate to using three Igusa invariants for generating a genus 2 curve. Using these techniques and or systems one may merely utilize two invariants to generate a genus 2 curve for example where the invariants are not Igusa invariants. In this way for example a genus two curve may be generated in a faster time using less computing resources as there are fewer invariants that are simpler to evaluate.

In one embodiment when generating a genus 2 curve for use in cryptography one or more invariant values which may be used to generate the genus 2 curve are determined by evaluating one or more invariant functions on a Hilbert modular surface. For example polynomials generated by the invariant functions evaluated on the Hilbert modular surface may be used as the invariant values for determining the curve. The genus 2 curve can then be generated using the one or more invariant values for example by using the invariant values e.g. polynomials in an algorithm to recover an equation that describes the curve. After the genus 2 curve is created a group such as a set of elements can be generated from the curve where the group is used for a cryptographic application.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

One or more of the cryptographic curve generation techniques and or systems described herein can create a genus 2 curve that can be used for cryptographic applications such as to create a cryptographic key.

Typically a curve based cryptosystem utilizes a group e.g. of elements and a binary multiplier whose size is known to a cryptosystem designer but is typically unknown and believed difficult to determine for potential malicious attackers of the cryptosystem. The curve based encryption and decryption illustrated in as an example typically refers to encryption and decryption that uses keys that are generated based on aspects or characteristics of an algebraic curve. The exemplary cryptosystems of are a function of the type of curve and a secret group size generated from the curve. In one embodiment of cryptographic curve generation the curve may be a Jacobian of a genus 2 curve and the secret group size can be the size of the group of points on the Jacobian of the genus 2 curve.

Curve based cryptosystems can be used to encrypt a wide variety of information. For example a cryptosystem may be used to generate a short signature or product identifier which is a code that allows validation and or authentication of a machine program or user for example. The signature can be a short signature in that it uses a relatively small number of characters.

An output module of the encryptor outputs an encrypted version of the plaintext message which can be ciphertext . Ciphertext which may comprise a string of unintelligible text or some other data can then be communicated to the decryptor which can be implemented for example on a computer system remote from a computer system on which encryptor is implemented. Given the encrypted nature of ciphertext the communication link between the encryptor and the decryptor need not be secure e.g. it is often presumed that the communication link is not secure . As an example the communication link can be one of a wide variety of public and or private networks implemented using one or more of a wide variety of conventional public and or proprietary protocols and including both wired and wireless implementations. Additionally the communication link may include other non computer network components such as hand delivery of media including ciphertext or other components of a product distribution chain.

The decryptor receives the ciphertext at an input module and because the decryptor is aware of the secret group size used to encrypt the message e.g. as well as the necessary generator can decrypt the ciphertext to recover the original plaintext message which is output by an output module as a plaintext message . In one embodiment the decryptor is a genus 2 curve based decryptor that decrypts the message based on the size of the group of points generated from the genus 2 curve e.g. a same value as was used by encryptor and is discussed in more detail below.

In one embodiment the encryption and decryption are performed in the exemplary cryptosystem based on a secret which may be the size of the group of points generated from the genus 2 curve. The secret is a shared secret as it is known to the decryptor and a public key can be generated based on the secret known to encryptor . In this embodiment this knowledge may allow the encryptor to encrypt a plaintext message that can be subsequently decrypted merely by the decryptor . Other components including the encryptor which do not have knowledge of the secret cannot decrypt the ciphertext e.g. although decryption may be technically possible it is not computationally feasible . Similarly in one embodiment the decryptor may also generate a message using the secret based on a plaintext message a process referred to as digitally signing the plaintext message. In this embodiment the signed message can be communicated to other components such as the encryptor which can verify the digital signature based on the public key.

A product ID generator can generate a product ID that may include numbers letters and or other symbols. The generator generates a product ID using the genus 2 curve based encryption techniques and or systems described herein. The product ID may be printed on a label and affixed to either a carrier containing software media or a box into which software media is placed. Alternatively the product ID may be made available electronically such as a certificate provided to a user when receiving a softcopy of the application program via an on line source e.g. downloading of the software via the Internet . The product ID can serve multiple functions such as being cryptographically validated to verify that the product ID is a valid product ID e.g. thus allowing the application program to be installed . As a further example the product ID may serve to authenticate the particular software media to which it is associated.

The generated software media and associated product ID can be provided to a distribution chain . The distribution chain can represent one or more of a variety of conventional distribution systems and methods including possibly one or more middlemen e.g. wholesalers suppliers distributors retail stores either on line or brick and mortar etc. and or electronic distribution such as over the Internet. Regardless of the manner in which media and the associated product ID are distributed the media and product ID are typically purchased by e.g. licensed or distributed to the user of a client computer for example.

The client computer can include a media reader that is capable of reading the software media and installing an application program onto client computer e.g. installing the application program on to a hard disk drive or memory not shown of client computer . In one embodiment part of the installation process can involve entering the product ID e.g. to validate a licensed copy . This entry may be a manual entry e.g. the user typing in the product ID via a keyboard or alternatively an automatic entry e.g. computer automatically accessing a particular field of a license associated with the application program and extracting the product ID therefrom . The client computer can also include a product ID validator which validates during installation of the application program the product ID . In one embodiment the validation can be performed using the genus 2 curve based decryption techniques and or systems described herein. If the validator determines that the product ID is valid an appropriate course of action can be taken e.g. an installation program on software media allows the application to be installed on computer . However if the validator determines that the product ID is invalid a different course of action can be taken e.g. the installation program terminates the installation process preventing the application program from being installed .

In one embodiment the product ID validator can also optionally authenticate the software media e.g. application program based on the product ID . This authentication verifies that the product ID entered at computer corresponds to the particular copy of the application be accessed for example. As an example the authentication may be performed at different times such as during installation or when requesting product support or an upgrade. Alternatively in this embodiment the authentication may be performed at a remote location e.g. at a call center when the user of client computer calls for technical support the user may be required to provide the product ID before receiving assistance .

In one embodiment if an application program manufacturer desires to utilize the authentication capabilities of the product ID the product ID generated by generator for respective copies of an application program should be unique. As an example unique product IDs can be created by assigning a different initial number or value to respective copies of the application program e.g. this initial value is then used as a basis for generating the product ID . The unique value associated with the copy of the application program can be optionally maintained by the manufacturer as an authentication record e.g. a database or list along with an indication of the particular copy of the application program. The indication of the copy can be for example a serial number embedded in the application program or on software media and may be hidden in any of a wide variety of conventional manners. Alternatively for example the individual number itself may be a serial number that is associated with the particular copy thereby allowing the manufacturer to verify the authenticity of an application program by extracting the initial value from the product ID and verifying that it is the same as the serial number embedded in the application program or software media .

A method may be devised that can allow a genus 2 curve to be generated where a group e.g. comprising points or elements can be created from the genus 2 curve and the group can be used for cryptography. Generating a genus 2 curve for use in cryptography is known to be a difficult problem with merely partial solutions in some cases. Effective cryptosystems are typically based on groups where a Discrete Logarithm Problem DLP for the group is hard e.g. difficult to calculate such as a group comprising points generated from the genus 2 curve. The DLP applies to groups which is a collection of elements together with a binary operation such as a group multiplication. As an illustrative example the DLP may be given an element g in a finite group G and another element h that is an element of G find an integer x such that g h.

Previously to construct a genus 2 curve for cryptographic purposes three auxiliary polynomials with rational coefficients such as Igusa invariants are computed. As an illustrative example these polynomials may have a form of X aX bX dX eX f where a b c d e f are fractions. In this example while the number 5 occurring in Xis used for illustration purposes this number may be much larger. Further in this example in order to generate the genus 2 curve three polynomials are computed which is very computationally expensive.

In this exemplary method invariant functions are evaluated on the Hilbert modular surface to create improved invariant values such as polynomials for generating the genus 2 curve equation for example. In this example the improvement is achieved by merely utilizing two invariant functions for generating the genus 2 curve instead of three Igusa invariants previously used. Further the improved invariant values on the Hilbert Modular surface are typically easier to calculate than the Igusa polynomials.

In one embodiment determining the invariant values can comprise evaluating one or more invariant functions on complex multiplication CM points on a Hilbert modular surface. Descriptions of CM points in the Hilbert moduli space is simpler than a description of CM points in terms of period matrices on the Siegel moduli space e.g. as with Igusa invariants . Additionally modular forms evaluated to compute invariants on the Hilbert moduli space are exponential functions in two variables instead of three as with the Igusa polynomials previously used.

In one embodiment invariant values can be determined by fixing a real quadratic field F. The Hilbert moduli space of principally polarized abelian surfaces can then be considered with real multiplication by O. In this embodiment using a forgetful functor one can map to the Siegel moduli space of the principally polarized abelian surfaces. Two generators of the function field of the Hilbert moduli space can be studied for example as given by K. B. Gundlach in Die Bestimmung der Funktionen zur Hilbertschen Modulgrupper des Zahlk rpers Q square root over 5 Math. Ann. 152 1963 226 256.

At the genus 2 curve is generated using the one or more invariant values. In one embodiment a genus 2 curve can be given by y f x curve equation over a finite field F where p is a prime number and where f is a polynomial of degree 2g 1 and g is the genus of the genus 2 curve. In this embodiment for example desired e.g. minimal polynomials determined by evaluating the invariant functions on the Hilbert modular surface can be used to generate the curve equation for the genus 2 curve.

At a group is created from the curve where the group is used for a cryptographic application. For example a group e.g. a set of elements and an operation that forms an algebraic structure generated from the genus 2 curve can have a solution for a discrete logarithm problem DLP that is considered hard. In this example a group having a hard DLP solution can be desirable for use in cryptographic applications such as for secure computer based communications. In one embodiment the group may be created by determining one or more Jacobian determinants Jacobians of the function of the genus 2 curve. A group comprising Jacobians of the curve is generally considered to have a hard DLP solution and can be very useful in a cryptographic application.

As an example the group may be used for cryptographic applications such as digital signatures that securely identify a person or document encryption and decryption of electronic documents and or keys and public and private keys that are used in online communications. Having created a group for use in a cryptographic application the exemplary method ends at .

In one aspect determining invariants for the genus 2 curve can involve defining new invariants which are different from previously utilized Igusa invariants for creating a genus 2 curve. In this aspect in one embodiment a Hilbert Eisenstein series can be computed for the invariant functions the new invariants can be defined and a pull back of the Igusa functions in terms of the new invariants can be computed.

A Hilbert modular form is called symmetric if z z z z for z z H. Further in this example for a ring R denote

In this embodiment then functions G and and can be primitively integral symmetric Hilbert modular forms for example and can be a minimal set of generators for M SL O Z .

Additionally in this embodiment the ring of symmetric holomorphic Hilbert modular forms for SL O is a polynomial ring of G G and such that dimM SL O x y z Z x 3y 5z k 2. In this embodiment the field of symmetric meromorphic Hilbert modular functions for SL O are rational functions of

Additionally in this embodiment can be pull backs of Siegel modular forms. For example this can be proven by 

In particular in this example can be 2times the square of the product of the ten Hilbert theta constants defined by 2 where is the weight 5 modular form defined by Gundlach see reference infra . Further the following proposition expresses the pull back of Igusa s functions in terms of the new invariants one has

At a CM field K is calculated for the corresponding group order and GF p . For example for a finite GF p the K for the group field given the order can be an extension of GF p comprising elements and an operation used for calculating a genus 2 curve. At one or more generators are determined for ideal classes of the CM field. At of the exemplary embodiment CM points on a Hilbert moduli space are determined corresponding to the ideal classes with polarizations.

In one embodiment let the CM field K F square root over be a non biquadratic quartic CM extension of field F Q square root over 5 . Further in constructing CM points let be a CM type of K. ACM point in X SL O Hof CM type O can be an image of a point z z z H where z K satisfies the condition that O OZ is a fractional ideal. Conversely if a is a fractional ideal of K one can write a O O a as F has class number one.

Additionally as F can have a unit of norm one one can find generator and e.g. multiplying by such a unit if necessary such that

In this embodiment CM K can be written as a formal sum of the CM points of CM type O and viewed as a 0 cycle in X where X has a canonical model over Q e.g. as a coarse moduli space of polarized abelian surfaces with real multiplication by O . Furthermore CM K can be defined over a reflex field tilde over K of K e.g. as moduli space of polarized abelian surfaces with complex multiplication Owith an extra condition on differentials related to . Where is another CM type CM K CM K CM K can be defined over Q.

Additionally the same lemma asserts that CM K is defined over Q itself when K is cyclic. Here if z is a CM point of CM type O associated to the ideal a for example z z is a CM point of CM type O associated to the same ideal a where is a unit of F such that 0 and 

This can be done for example by using a notation such as where tilde over K is a reflex field of K . In this example it is also a quartic CM number field with real quadratic subfield tilde over F . Here let dbe a relative discriminant of K F and dbe an absolute discriminant of K. For a nonzero element

At in the exemplary method the invariants at the CM points are evaluated to form desired polynomials of the invariants. For example in one embodiment J z a and J z a e.g. the new invariants are calculated using the following let h hbe the ideal class number of K and assume G z 0 and d 5q for a prime q 1 mod 4. Further let

At in the exemplary embodiment the desired polynomials are reduced modulo a prime p and roots modulo the prime are determined. For example the polynomials are reduced modulo p not dividing the denominators and finding the roots mod p .

At the roots are applied to Mestre s algorithm pulled back to the Hilbert moduli space to generate the genus 2 curve where the output is the equation of the genus 2 curve over the GF p having the desired group order at . For example j mod p can be calculated using the formulas described above 

Mestre s algorithm can then be applied to construct a genus 2 curve over the finite field F. In one embodiment a variation of Mestre s algorithm can be used to generate the curve using the invariant values. For example Mestre s algorithm has previously been used to generate a genus two curve with Igusa invariants. In this example let k be a field of characteristic not equal to 2. Here a genus curve x over k is determined by its Igusa invariants j X F.

Conversely however given j k one might not always find a genus two curve X defined over k such that j X jalthough such a curve X exists over a finite extension of k. This may be due to a subtle difference between the definition field of x as a point in C k e.g. field of moduli and a definition field of x as a curve e.g. the minimal field where X has a model . Mestre discovered an algorithm to tell whether such a curve X over k exists and how to construct a model of X over k if it exists. Using Mestre s definition one can get a formula for x y z in terms of Igusa s A B C and D as follows set

To get the equation used for the genus 2 curve generation described above from Mestre s one can write the curve M in terms of vinstead of his x then divide the resulting equation by 2 3 5II. Here care absolute invariants while aare not. The genus two curve X with Igusa invariants j X jhas a model over a field k of characteristic not equal to 2 if and only if L k is not empty.

In this embodiment suppose the conic L has a rational point over k. Using this point rewrite it as parametric function v t . for some quadratic polynomial of t. For example this gives an explicit isomorphism between L and Pover k. These equations can be plugged into the equation for the cubic curve M to obtain a polynomial equation of t of degree 6 such as t 0. Then the genus two curve C can be given by X s t .

In one embodiment the generation of the genus 2 curve may be described as using a variation of Mestre s algorithm where Mestre s algorithm is pulled back to a Hilbert moduli space. In this embodiment the Igusa invariants are pulled back to invariants on a Hilbert modular space as described above. Further the invariant values are expressed on a Hilbert modular space in terms of generators given by the one or more invariant functions on a Hilbert modular surface.

A system can be devised that can compute genus 2 curves for example by defining a set of invariants simpler than previously used Igusa invariants.

Additionally the group generated by the group creation component comprise a discrete logarithm problem DLP solution that is hard to solve. In this way for example the group may be desirable for use in cryptographic applications such as encryption and decryption of documents.

Additionally the exemplary embodiment comprises a Mestre s algorithm adaptation component that can adapt the Mestre s algorithm for generating the genus 2 curve to an algorithm that uses the invariant polynomials on a Hilbert modular surface to generate the genus 2 curve .

Additionally in the exemplary embodiment the group creation component comprises a Jacobian determination component that determines a Jacobian of the genus 2 curve to create a group used for the cryptographic application. For example a group created from the Jacobian can have a DLP solution that is hard therefore being desirable for cryptographic applications.

In this embodiment the curve generation component further comprises a CM point determination component that is operably coupled with the ideal class generation component and configured to determine CM points on a Hilbert moduli space corresponding to the ideal classes with polarizations.
