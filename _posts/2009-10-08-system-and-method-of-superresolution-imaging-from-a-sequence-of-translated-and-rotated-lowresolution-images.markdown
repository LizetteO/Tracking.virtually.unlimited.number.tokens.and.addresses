This application is a Continuation In Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 038 401 filed Jan. 19 2005 entitled METHOD FOR SUPER RESOLVING IMAGES to which priority is being claimed under 35 U.S.C. 120 and hereby incorporated by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and or licensed by or for the United States Government.

This invention relates in general to a method of digital image processing and more specifically relates to super resolution image reconstruction.

Many low cost sensors or cameras may spatially or electronically undersample an image. Similarly cameras taking pictures from great distances such as aerial photos may not obtain detailed information about the subject matter. This may result in aliased images in which the high frequency components are folded into the low frequency components in the image. Consequently subtle or detail information high frequency components are not present in the images. Super resolution image reconstruction generally increases image resolution without necessitating a change in the design of the optics and or detectors by using a sequence or a few snapshots of low resolution images. Super resolution image reconstruction algorithms effectively de alias undersampled images to obtain a substantially alias free or as identified in the literature a super resolved image.

When undersampled images have sub pixel translations and rotations between successive frames they contain different information regarding the same scene. Super resolution image reconstruction involves inter alia combining information contained in undersampled images to obtain an alias free high resolution image. Super resolution image reconstruction from multiple snapshots taken by a detector which has shifted and or rotated in position provides far more detail information than any interpolated image from a single snapshot.

Generally super resolution image reconstruction involves acquiring a sequence of images from the same scene with sub pixel translations and rotations among the images. The methods for acquiring low resolution images with sub pixel translations and rotations include acquiring images affected by translation and or rotation.

One of these methods is to have controlled sub pixel translations and rotations in which each image is captured by linearly displacing the sensor a known fraction pixel displacement as for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 344 893 Super resolving imaging system Feb. 5 2002 D. Mendlovic et. al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 483 952 Super resolution methods for electro optical systems Nov. 19 2002 D. D. Gregory et. al. Or the super resolution image reconstruction may involve images acquired by rotating an image array about the optical axis as for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 642 497 System for improving image resolution via sensor rotation Nov. 4 2003 J. Apostolopoulos et al. Generally the acquired images in super resolution image reconstruction contain sub pixel translations and or rotations.

Methods for super resolving images that contain sub pixel translations and or rotations are in the following references.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 323 681 to Oldham et. al. Image enhancement by sub pixel imaging issued Jan. 29 2008 teaches a method of using a linear reconstruction approach as described in A. S. Fruchter et al. Drizzle a Method for the Linear Reconstruction of Undersampled Images Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific vol. 114 pp. 144 152 February 2002. In this method the target s orientation relative to the detector may be rotated and or translated so as to yield a generalized mapping between a pixel space of the low resolution image and a relatively smaller pixel space of the high resolution image. The sub pixel s output representing high resolution image pixel values may be achieved by summing the contributions of image values of the overlapping pixels from a number of low resolution images. In order to improve sub pixel output approximation the mapping includes a surface intensity term which compensates for the small overlapping of pixels due to rotation.

Tipping et. al. and U.S. Patent Application Publication US2007 0130095 Bayesian approach for sensor super resolution Jun. 7 2007 M. A Peot and M Aguilar disclose a statistical Bayesian inverse processing method in which an observation model is formulated to relate the original high resolution image to the observed low resolution images. Parameters including rotation and translation are obtained by optimizing a marginal likelihood of low resolution images in which the marginal likelihood is a function of the alignment and rotation parameters. Then the full high resolution image is derived in an inference operation using these parameters.

U.S. Patent Application Publication US2007 0196009 Method for operating an X ray diagnostic device for the generation of high resolution images Aug. 23 2007 to Deinzer discloses a method involving translations and rotations among low resolution X ray images that are determined by a minimization approach. The high resolution X ray image is obtained by performing bilinear interpolation approach.

There is a need to produce high resolution images from a sequence of low resolution images captured by a low cost imaging device that has experienced translations and or rotations. The amount of sub pixel translation and or rotation may be unknown and it creates a need to estimate sub pixel translation and rotation. In order to produce high resolution images from a sequence of translated and rotated undersampled low resolution images there exists a need to eliminate aliasing while taking into account natural jitter.

The present invention provides a method and system for the super resolving images reconstructed from sequences of lower resolution aliased imagery affected by translations and rotations of the detector e.g. camera during image capture.

The present invention utilizes a sequence of undersampled low resolution images from the same scene with sub pixel translations and rotations among the images to reconstruct an alias free high resolution image or to produce a sequence of such alias free high resolution frames as in a video sequence. The undersampled low resolution images may be captured in the presence of natural jitter or some kind of controlled motion of the camera. For example the natural jitter may be the result of a vehicle traveling down a bumpy road or an aircraft experiencing turbulence. The present invention is adaptable to situations where prior knowledge about the high resolution image is unknown as well when unknown irregular or uncontrolled sub pixel translations and rotations have occurred among the low resolution images.

As depicted in a sequence of original input low resolution images is passed into a translation and rotation parameter estimation algorithm Box that includes a gross shift estimation algorithm Box from which an estimate of the overall shift of each frame with respect to a reference frame is obtained and a sub pixel translation and rotation estimation algorithm Box . Input images on successive frames contain not only sub pixel shifts but also the integer pixel shifts. Since the common center area of the images contributes most to the rotation angle estimation the gross shifts integer pixel shifts among frames are estimated and compensated for and the input images are realigned. The sub pixel translations and rotations are then estimated for each frame with respect to a reference frame Box . An error reduction algorithm is applied Box to the input low resolution images with the estimated sub pixel shifts and rotations among images to obtain the high resolution alias free output.

According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method of super resolving images from low resolution sequences affected by translations and rotations comprising the steps of inputting multiple undersampled low resolution input images of the same scene with sub pixel translations and rotations among images into an image processor obtaining the gross translation for each image with respect to a reference image on the image processor aligning the inputted images according to the gross translation estimates on the image processor applying a sub pixel translation and rotation estimation algorithm on the image processor to the aligned undersampled input images to obtain the sub pixel shift and rotation of each image with respect to a reference image Box and applying an error reduction algorithm Box for translated and rotated undersampled input low resolution images with the estimated sub pixel shifts and rotations among images to produce a high resolution alias free output image from the image processor.

The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which embodiments of the invention are shown. However this invention should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.

The method of acquiring a sequence of images in super resolution image reconstruction in this embodiment may involve non controlled sub pixel translations and rotations e.g. natural jitter. This can be more cost effective and more practical than the controlled sub pixel translation and rotation image acquisition. In many applications the imager may be carried by a moving platform or the object itself may be moving. In military reconnaissance situations the moving platform may be a person an unmanned ground vehicle UGV or an unmanned aerial vehicle UAV flying in a circular motion. As a result acquired images may contain sub pixel translations and or rotations. During the process of super resolution image reconstruction after multiple sub pixel translated and or rotated images are obtained they are then combined to reconstruct the high resolution image by projecting low resolution images onto a high resolution grid which is of a finer sampled grid than the lower resolution grid. The sub pixel translations and rotations found in images resulting from natural jitter pose a need for accurate estimation.

In Box of the sub pixel translation and rotation are estimated for each frame with respect to a reference frame. In Box of an error energy reduction algorithm for translated and rotated images is applied to the input images with the estimated sub pixel shifts and rotations among images to obtain the high resolution alias free output image. The output may be either a single high resolution image that is generated from a sequence of low resolution images or a sequence of high resolution images that are generated from multiple sequences of low resolution images.

Two image frames of a low resolution image sequence may be designated f x y and f u v . Because of the conditions under which the frames are acquired the second image is a shifted and or rotated version of the first image that is 

Signal Registration The signal registration method is described in the following. Almost all of the transformation parameter estimation methods are based on the signal registration method. It is assumed that the signals to be matched differ only by an unknown translation. In practice beside translation there may be rotation noise and geometrical distortions. Nevertheless the signal registration description offers a fundamental solution to the problem. The procedure for pixel level registration is to first calculate the correlation between two images f x y and f x y as 

A signal registration based correlation method is used for translation parameter estimation between two images based on 1 the correlation theorem and 2 the shift property of Fourier transform. This method begins with the cross correlation between two images. The terminology cross correlation or cross correlation as used herein is a measure of similarity of two frames in terms of a function of one of them. The two dimensional normalized cross correlation function measures the similarity for each translation 

Correlation Theorem More efficient signal registration method for translation estimation is using the correlation method in the spatial frequency domain via the Correlation Theorem. The Correlation Theorem states that the Fourier transform of the cross correlation of two images is the product of the Fourier transform of one image and the complex conjugate of the Fourier transform of the other that is C Equation 7 where F k k and F k k are Fourier transforms of two images f x y and f x y respectively F k k is the conjugate of F k k .

Fourier Transform Properties The properties of Fourier transform are described in the following that include shift property of Fourier transform polar transformation and polar function mapping and rotation property of Fourier transform. A Fourier transform is an operation that transforms one complex valued function of a real variable into a new function. In such applications as image processing the domain of the original function is typically space and is accordingly called the spatial domain. The domain of the new function is spatial frequency and so the Fourier transform is often called the spatial frequency domain or Fourier domain representation of the original function as it describes which frequencies are present in the original function. As used herein the terminology Fourier transform refers both to the frequency domain representation of a function and to the process or formula that transforms one function into the other.

Shift Property of Fourier Transform Two members of the image sequence are denoted by f x y and f x y . The second image is a shifted version of the first image such as Equation 8 where x y are the relative shifts translational differences between f x y and f x y . Then exp Equation 9 where F k k and F k k are Fourier transforms of two images. Thus a shift in one domain results in the addition of a linear phase function in the Fourier domain.

Polar Transform and Polar Function Mapping The polar transformation of the domain x y for a 2 D signal f x y may be represented by Equation 10 where

Rotation Property of Fourier Transform Two members of the image sequence are denoted f x y and f u v the second image being a rotated version of the first image 

The gross translation estimation Box is described in the following. The second image can be expressed as a shifted version of the first image such as 

According to the Correlation Theorem the Fourier transform of the cross correlation of the two images f x y and f x y can be found as follows Equation 7 where F k k and F k k are Fourier transforms of two images f x y and f x y respectively F k k is the conjugate of F k k .

Using the shift property of Fourier transform the Fourier transform F k k can be substituted via exp Equation 9 Then the Fourier transform of the cross correlation of the two images f x y and f x y that is the product of the Fourier transform of one image and the complex conjugate of the Fourier transform of the other can then be expressed as

Translation Estimation with Aliasing Consideration Since both images f x y and f u v are aliased i.e. the high frequency components are folded into a portion of low frequency components. In general for an aliased image the image energy at lower frequency components is stronger than the folded high frequency components. Thus the signal to aliasing power ratio is relatively high around k k 0 0 . Therefore a low pass filtering W is applied to the Fourier transforms F k k and F k k . A schematic diagram of the computational efficient translation estimation method as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 038 401 Method of Super Resolving Images filed Jan. 19 2005 S. S. Young hereby incorporated by reference is shown in .

Since the Fourier transform can be computed efficiently with existing well tested programs of FFT fast Fourier transform and occasionally in hardware using specialized optics the use of the FFT becomes most beneficial for cases where the images to be tested are large as described in L. G. Brown A survey of image registration techniques ACM Computing Survey Vol. 24 No. 4 December 1992 pp. 325 376.

Translation Estimation with Sub pixel Accuracy and Aliasing Consideration The sub pixel translation estimation Box is described in the following. In super resolution image reconstruction of a preferred embodiment sub pixel shifts or fractional pixel displacements among the input images are estimated using a method to estimate or calculate frame to frame motion within sub pixel accuracy. In general the smallest motion that can be obtained from conventional motion estimation is one pixel. Obtaining sub pixel motion accurately is not straightforward. A method to achieve the sub pixel accuracy solution has been described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 038 401 Method of Super Resolving Images. This method is based on resampling via frequency domain interpolation by using a Fourier windowing method as described in S. S. Young Alias free image subsampling using Fourier based windowing methods Optical Engineering Vol. 43 No. 4 April 2004 pp. 843 855 hereby incorporated by reference called power window.

Because the low resolution input images contain aliasing a low pass filter is applied to the input images first. A schematic diagram of the computational efficient sub pixel translation estimation method as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 038 401 Method of Super Resolving Images filed Jan. 19 2005 S. S. Young is illustrated in .

The sub pixel translation and rotational estimation Box is described in the following. Assuming the second image is a shifted and rotated version of the first image i.e. 

From the shift property of Fourier transform of these images the following relation is derived exp Equation 9 where F k k and F k k are the Fourier transforms of the two images and the k k domain is the rotated version of the k k domain that is 

Then from the polar transformation the rotation and shift properties of Fourier transform as described previously the polar function mappings see operation in Equation 12 of the 2 D Fourier transforms of the two images are related by exp Equation 19 

Thus for their magnitudes we have Equation 20 That is if one image is a rotated and shifted version of the other image then the magnitude of polar function mapping of one is the shifted version of the magnitude of polar function mapping of the other one in the spatial frequency domain.

Note the difference between Equation 20 and Equation 16 . One image is represented as a rotated version of the other image in Equation 16 while one image is represented as a rotated and shifted version of the other image in Equation 20 .

Therefore the rotation angle difference is represented as a translational difference using the polar transformation and polar function mapping of Fourier transform. Using the correlation method the rotation angle between the two images is estimated in a manner similar to the translation estimation.

The rotation estimation is described in the following in detail. Because the rotation difference is only represented in the first domain of the Fourier transform the rotation angle is found as the peak of inverse of the marginal 1 D Fourier transform of the cross correlation with respect to . The marginal 1 D Fourier transform is an operation of performing the one dimensional Fourier transform of a 2 D function f x y with respect to one of the variables x or y.

The marginal 1 D Fourier transform of the cross correlation with respect to between the two images is defined as Equation 21 where k and k are the marginal 1 D Fourier transforms with respect to for the two images F and F as defined in Equation 12 respectively and k is the complex conjugate of k 

After the rotation angle is estimated the second image is rotated back by the angle to form the backward rotated image f x y . Then the shifts x y between the two images are estimated between f x y and f x y according to the correlation method based on the Correlation Theorem and the shift property of Fourier transform as discussed previously.

Rotation and Translation Estimation with Sub pixel Accuracy Similar as in the translation estimation with sub pixel accuracy the rotation estimation with sub pixel accuracy is achieved by resampling via frequency domain interpolation. However the resampling operation is only performed in the domain as defined in Equation 13 since the rotation angle is the only parameter to be estimated. The subsequent sub pixel translation estimation x y between the backward rotated image f x y and the first image f x y is achieved by resampling for both kand kdomains via frequency domain interpolation see .

Rotation with Aliasing Consideration The common center area of the two images f x y and f u v contributes most to the rotation angle estimation. A radially symmetrical window is applied to both images to emphasize the center common region between the two images. This radially symmetrical window is also designed as a low pass filter to achieve accurate rotation estimation by filtering out the aliased high frequency components in the input images. As mentioned previously the terminology aliased refers to the high frequency components folded into a portion of low frequency components. In general for an aliased image the image energy at lower frequency components is stronger than the folded high frequency components. Thus the signal to aliasing power ratio is relatively high around k k 0 0 .

The radially symmetrical and low pass window W is applied to the Fourier transforms F k k and F k k in the first step of the rotation estimation procedure that is Equation 22 Equation 22 Sub Pixel Rotation and Translation Estimation Procedure

A procedure to estimate translation and rotation parameters with sub pixel accuracy between two images f x y and f u v is summarized in the following. shows a schematic representation of this estimating algorithm which may comprise 

An illustration of translation and rotation estimation with sub pixel accuracy is shown in and . In this example we use a high resolution forward looking infrared FLIR image to simulate a sequence of low resolution undersampled images with translations and rotations.

An original FLIR tank image is shown in . The size of this image is 40 76. First we up sample this image using the Fourier windowing method by a factor of 30 to obtain a simulated high resolution image with a size of 1200 2280 as shown in . Then the low resolution images are generated from this simulated high resolution image by sub sampling and rotating. The randomly selected translation and rotation parameters for six of each low resolution image are listed as follows x 0 3.1 7.7 12.3 14.1 17.3 y 0 2.3 8.5 11.2 15.2 16.8 0 14.4 15.6 17.8 19.1 22.7 The units of xand yare pixels and the unit of is degrees. shows six simulated low resolution images with shifts and rotates among them.

After applying the correlation method for sub pixel shift and rotation estimation to these 6 simulated low resolution images the sub pixel shift and rotation values are obtained. The estimated sub pixel shift and rotation values are all correct according to the actual values. shows the transformation of the plane of one image image into the target domain of the reference image image .

Error Energy Reduction Algorithm for Translated and Rotated Input Images An error energy reduction algorithm for translated and rotated images is derived to reconstruct the high resolution alias free output image. A primary feature of this proposed error energy reduction algorithm for translated and rotated images is that we treat the spatial samples from low resolution images that possess unknown and irregular uncontrolled sub pixel shifts and rotations as a set of constraints to populate an over sampled sampled above the desired output bandwidth processing array. The estimated sub pixel shifted and rotated locations of these samples and their values constitute a spatial domain constraint. Furthermore the bandwidth of the alias free image or the sensor imposed bandwidth is the criterion used as a spatial frequency domain constraint on the over sampled processing array.

In an error energy reduction algorithm the high resolution image is reconstructed by removing aliasing from low resolution images. The high resolution image is reconstructed by applying non uniform interpolation using the constraints both in the spatial and spatial frequency domains. The algorithm is based on the concept that the error energy is reduced by imposing both spatial and spatial frequency domain constraints the samples from the low resolution images and the bandwidth of the high resolution alias free output image.

In accordance with the error energy reduction algorithm of the present invention spatial samples from low resolution images that possess unknown and irregular uncontrolled sub pixel shifts and rotations are treated as a set of constraints to populate an over sampled sampled above the desired output bandwidth processing array. The estimated sub pixel locations of these samples and their values constitute a spatial domain constraint. Furthermore the bandwidth of the alias free image or the sensor imposed bandwidth is the criterion used as a spatial frequency domain constraint on the over sampled processing array. One may also incorporate other spatial or spatial frequency domain constraints that have been used by others e.g. positivity of the image in the spatial domain.

Image acquisition model shows the system model for acquiring an undersampled image in a one dimensional case. Let f x be the ideal target signature that is interrogated by the sensor. The measured target signature g x by the sensor is modeled as the output of a Linear Shift Invariant LSI system whose impulse response is the sensor s point spread function PSF h x this is also known as the sensor blurring function. The relationship between the measured target signature and the original target signature in the spatial frequency kdomain is where G k F k and H k are the Fourier transforms of g x f x and h x respectively.

Assuming the measurement system stores the incoming images at the sample spacing of the measured target signature g x is then sampled at the integer multiples of e.g. x n n 0 1 2 . . . N to obtain the undersampled aliased image the resultant can be modeled as the following delta sampled signal in the spatial domain see 

As mentioned previously many low resolution sensors possess a spatial sample spacing that violate the Nyquist rate. The emphasis of the super resolution image reconstruction algorithm in a preferred embodiment is to de alias a sequence of undersampled aliased images to obtain the alias free or a super resolved image. Again it should be emphasized that the resolution of the output alias free image is limited by the minimum bandwidth of the sensor and the ideal target signature.

One of the considerations in super resolution image reconstruction is the number of the undersampled images that are required to recover the alias free image. Assuming the sampling space of the original undersampled images to be . From an information theory point of view the sampling space of the output high resolution image that is reconstructed from k frames with distinct sub pixel shifts is

A numerical example is given in the following. An image array of 100 100 is initially acquired to represent a scene. The total number of pixels is 10 000. If the resolution of the image is desired to be 4 times in each direction the image array of 400 400 is required. The total number of pixels for the high resolution image is 160 000. That means that it requires 16 low resolution images to achieve the resolution improvement factor of 4. Therefore the number of input low resolution image frames is the square of the resolution improvement factor. In other words the resolution improvement factor is the square root of the number of the input images.

Theoretically more frames should provide more information and thus larger bandwidth and or higher resolution. However the super resolution image quality does not improve when the number of processed undersampled images exceeds a certain value. This is due to the fact that the bandwidth recovery is limited by the minimum of the bandwidths of the sensor or ideal target signature.

Implementation of Error Energy Reduction Algorithm The bandwidth of the input undersampled aliased images is designated B. The bandwidth of the alias free high resolution output image is denoted as B. In order to recover the desired alias free bandwidth it is important to select a processing array with a sample spacing smaller than the sample spacing of the desired high resolution image. In this case the 2D FFT of the processing array yields a spectral coverage Bthat is larger than the bandwidth of the output image. illustrates this phenomenon in the 2D spatial frequency domain.

The high resolution alias free image on the processing array grid is designated as p x y . The low resolution aliased snap shots only provide a sub set of samples of this image. The location of each aliased image on the processing grid is dictated by its corresponding sub pixel shifts and rotations in the x y domain.

In the following the error energy reduction algorithm is described for the input images containing both translational shifts and rotational differences. shows a schematic representation of the error energy reduction algorithm for input image sequences transformed by both translations and rotations.

Inputs to the error energy reduction algorithm are a sequence of low resolution input images and the estimated sub pixel shifts and rotations of each image with respect to the reference image usually the first image is chosen as the reference image. Denote f u v to be L images from the input image sequence where l 1 2 . . . L i 1 2 . . . I j 1 2 . . . J I J is the dimension of the input image. After the transformation parameters tilde over tilde over x tilde over y are estimated for all L images the transform coordinates are calculated from the estimated sub pixel shifts and rotation angles as follows 

In the initializing step Box the processing array is initialized by populating the grids using the input images according to the estimates of the sub pixel shifts and rotation angles. A processing array is selected with a sample spacing that is smaller than the sample spacing of the desired high resolution image.

In this procedure the available image values from multiple snapshots are assigned to each sub pixel shifted and rotated grid location of the processing array. At the other grid locations of the processing array zero values are assigned. This can be written as

In Box a 2 D Fourier transform P k k is preformed on the processing array. Its spectrum has a wider bandwidth than the true desired output bandwidth. Therefore the spatial frequency domain constraint Box is applied that is replacing zeros outside the desired bandwidth. The function is formed where W k k is a windowing function of realizing the spatial frequency domain constraint. In Box the inverse 2 D Fourier transform p x y of the resultant array P k k is performed.

The resultant inverse array is not a true image because the image values at the known grid locations are not equal to the original image values. Then the spatial domain constraint is applied Box that is replacing those image values at the known grid locations with the known original image values.

In this step of applying spatial domain constraints using shifts and rotations Box we have the function

Similarly the use of the available information in the spatial and spatial frequency domains results in a reduction of the energy of the error at each iteration step. At the odd steps of the iteration the error is defined by

An illustration of super resolving images from low resolution sequences transformed by translations and rotations is shown in . The 6 input low resolution images that are transformed by translations and rotations are shown in . The estimated sub pixel shift and rotation values are all correct according to the actual values as described previously. The reconstructed image from these 6 input low resolution images using the error energy reduction algorithm is shown in . For the comparison purpose one of the low resolution input images is displayed in . By observing it can be seen that the super resolved image shows a significant improvement from the low resolution image by exhibiting the detailed information especially in the wheel turret and barrel areas. This illustrates that the super resolved image is obtained even under the condition that the low resolution input images contain both shifts and rotations among them.

In the present invention the super resolution image reconstruction can also be implemented in a sequential manner as shown an alternative embodiment in .

The input images are divided into sub sequences first. Each sub sequence passes through the super resolution image reconstruction algorithm to generate one output image. The images that are generated from all sub sequences are then re grouped to form a new sequence. Obviously the number of images of this new sequence is less than the number of original input images. This new sequence is again divided into sub sequences.
