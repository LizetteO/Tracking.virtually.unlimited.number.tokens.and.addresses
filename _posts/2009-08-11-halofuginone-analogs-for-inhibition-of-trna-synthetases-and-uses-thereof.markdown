No. 61 188 740 filed Aug. 11 2008 and U.S. Ser. No. 61 153 866 filed Feb. 19 2009 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with U.S. Government support under HD029468 and CA078048 awarded by National Institutes of Health. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

Halofuginone 1 is a halogenated derivative of febrifugine 3 a natural product extracted from the roots of the hydrangea is one of the fifty fundamental herbs of traditional Chinese medicine originally used as an anti malarial remedy Jiang et al. . 2005 49 1169 1176 . Halofuginone otherwise known as 7 bromo 6 chloro 3 3 3 hydroxy 2 piperidinyl 2 oxopropyl 4 3H quinazolinone and halofuginone derivatives were first described in U.S. Pat. No. 2 694 711 incorporated herein by reference. Febrifugine has been shown to be the active ingredient in extracts halofuginone was originally synthesized in search of less toxic anti malarial derivatives of febrifugine. In addition to its anti malarial properties however halofuginone has striking anti fibrotic properties in vivo Pines et al. 2003 9 417 425 U.S. Pat. No. 6 028 075 incorporated herein by reference . Halofuginone shows some toxicity in humans such as nausea vomiting and fatigue and possibly bleeding complications de Jonge et al. 2006 42 1768 1774 .

Since halofuginone has shown promising biological activities there remains a need for identifying further related compounds with useful biological activities especially those that may be less toxic than halofuginone or febrifugine.

The present invention stems from the recognition that analogs of the quinazolinone alkaloid halofuginone are inhibitors of metazoan glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase EPRS particularly mammalian EPRS and or non metazoan prolyl tRNA synthetase particularly protozoan tRNA synthetase. Inhibitors of EPRS such as halofuginone and halofuginone analogs can inhibit the pro fibrotic behavior of fibroblasts and Table 1 and therefore may be useful in treating disorders associated with fibrosis. In addition halofuginone and analogs of halofuginone are useful in the modification of effector T cell differentiation and Table 2 and therefore may be useful in treating diseases such as inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore halofuginone and halofuginone analogs can inhibit angiogenesis and may be useful in treating tumor neovascularization and ocular diseases involving choroidal neovascularization and retinal edema. Halofuginone and halofuginone analogs may also be useful as antiprotozoal agents given their ability to inhibit protozoal prolyl tRNA synthetase. The present invention provides novel classes of quinazolinones quinolinones and heteroaryl derivatives of halofuginone and analogs thereof. The inventive compounds may have more desirable properties than halofuginone. For example the inventive compounds may be less toxic than halofuginone or febrifugine and or the inventive compounds may be more potent than halofuginone or febrifugine.

Some of the analogs of halofuginone 1 described herein act as inhibitors of metazoan glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase EPRS or non metazoan prolyl tRNA synthetase. See . In certain embodiments the EPRS is a eukaryotic EPRS. In certain embodiments the EPRS is a human EPRS. In certain embodiments the prolyl tRNA synthetase is a protozoan prolyl tRNA synthetase. A structural feature of these inhibitors is a piperidine or pyrrolidine ring or an analog thereof. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory it is believed that the piperidine ring of halofuginone 1 acts by binding in the active site of the tRNA synthetase like the pyrrolidine ring of proline thus preventing the charging of the amino acid proline to the tRNA synthetase.

Inhibition of EPRS or other tRNA synthetases leads to the accumulation of uncharged prolyl tRNAs which in turn activates the amino acid starvation response AAR . Activation of the AAR in T cells suppresses the differentiation of a subset of effector T cells Th17 cells that promote autoimmunity. AAR also suppresses pro fibrotic gene expression and viral gene expression replication and maturation. AAR may contribute to the protection of organs from stress e.g. ER stress in the pancreas during the development of diabetes .

Inhibition of EPRS suppresses the synthesis and accumulation of proteins such as polyglutamine containing proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington s disease. This class of EPRS inhibitors also promotes autophagy a process that clears protein aggregates in diseases such as Huntington s disease Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS . Halofuginone and similarly active compounds are therefore useful as promoters of autophagy.

The specific inhibition of EPRS as opposed to other tRNA synthetases also inhibits the synthesis of proline rich proteins such as collagen which may be useful for the inhibition of scarring and fibrosis due to excess collagen deposition. Inhibition of collagen synthesis may be useful for cosmetic and therapeutic applications. The role of collagen in fibrosis makes the inventive compounds useful in various cosmetic and therapeutic applications associated with the accumulation of collagen.

The synthesis of collagen and the degradation and remodelling of the ECM are also involved in a number of physiological and pathological conditions including angiogenesis systemic sclerosis graft versus host disease GVHD pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis and autoimmune diseases. These disease are many times associated with the excessive production of connective tissue components particularly collagen which results in the destruction of normal tissue architecture and function. Therefore the inventive compounds may be useful in treating or preventing these diseases associated with collagen accumulation or the degradation and remodelling of the ECM.

Halofuginone activates phosphorylation of eIF2alpha a downstream component of the amino acid starvation response. The activation of eIF2alpha leads to the stimulation of an upstream kinase GCN2 the activation of which is monitored by measuring its state of phosphorylation. shows that GCN2 is phosphorylated in response to halofuginone but not an inactive derivative of halofuginone. The ability of halofuginone to stimulate eIF2alpha phosphorylation is dependent on GCN2 as the ability to stimulate eIF2alpha is lost in cells lacking GCN2 . Activation of GCN2 is well established to be regulated by the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs Dong et al. . 2000 6 269 279 . These data indicate that halofuginone acts either to limit the availability of amino acids for tRNA charging or to inhibit the enzymes that charge tRNA the amino acyl tRNA synthetases. The data detailed below show that halofuginone inhibits an amino acyl tRNA synthetase in particular EPRS.

To distinguish these possibilities the effect of halofuginone on protein translation was examined in an in vitro system rabbit reticulocyte lysate in which amino acids are already present at levels adequate to support protein synthesis. In this system halofuginone at 400 nM inhibits translation of luciferase by 5 6 orders of magnitude ruling out the possibility that halofuginone modifies amino acid synthesis or transport and indicating that it blocks tRNA synthetase activity. Distinct tRNA synthetases catalyze the charging of individual tRNA species with their cognate amino acid. To determine which tRNA synthetase is inhibited by halofuginone several amino acid mixtures were added to the in vitro translation system to determine which if any could reverse the inhibition of translation by halofuginone . When a mixture containing serine phenylalanine and proline was found to reverse the effect of halofuginone Mix 4 the effect of each amino acid was tested. Only proline could rescue halofuginone inhibition indicating that glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase EPRS the enzyme responsible for proline tRNA aminoacylation is specifically inhibited by halofuginone. To examine whether proline could specifically rescue the effect of halofuginone in intact cells the ability of each amino acid to reverse the effect of halofuginone on eIF2alpha phosphorylation in T cells or to prevent halofuginone inhibition of Th17 differentiation was tested . Only proline had an effect in these assays confirming that EPRS is the target for halofuginone in intact cells. Inhibition of EPRS with compounds of the current invention can inhibit Th17 differentiation.

Compounds of the invention may be screened to identify biological activity e.g. the ability to modulate the development and or expansion of Th17 cells by inhibiting EPRS e.g. IL 17 secreting cells in a subject. An assay for screening selective inhibitors of IL 17 expressing cell development and or expansion such as IL 17 expressing effector T cell development and or expansion e.g. Th17 development and or expansion includes contacting a na ve T cell population with a test compound under conditions sufficient to allow T cell development and or expansion culturing the cell population and detecting the level of IL 17 expression and or the number of Th17 cells in the cell population wherein no change or a decrease in the level of IL 17 expression in the cell population indicates that the test compound is a selective Th17 inhibitor and or wherein no change or a decrease in the number of Th17 cells in the cell population indicates that the test compound is a selective Th17 inhibitor. Determining the level of IL 17 expression and or the number of Th17 cells in the cell population can be accomplished for example by using a detection agent that binds to IL 17 or other marker for Th17 cells for example the Th17 specific transcription factor RORgammat ROR t . The detection agent is for example an antibody. The detection agent can be coupled with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the detection agent to IL 17 or other Th17 marker can be determined by detecting the labeled compound. For example the detection agent can be labeled with I S C or H either directly or indirectly and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of radioemission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively detection agents can be enzymatically labeled with for example horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase or luciferase and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to product.

Methods of Modulating Th17 Cell Differentiation and or Proliferation and Other Cellular Functions Using Halofuginone Analogs and Compositions Thereof

Halofuginone and analogs thereof have been found to specifically alter the development of T cells away from the Th17 lineage which is associated with cell mediated damage persistent inflammation and autoimmunity.

Th17 cells secrete several cytokines that may have a role in promoting inflammation and fibrosis including IL 17 IL 6 IL 21 and GM CSF. Of these cytokines IL 17 is a specific product of Th17 cells and not other T cells. Whether Th17 cells are the only source of IL 17 during inflammatory response is not clear but elevated IL 17 levels are in general thought to reflect expansion of the Th17 cell population.

Diseases that have been associated with expansion of a Th17 cell population or increased IL 17 production include but are not limited to rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis Crohn s disease inflammatory bowel disease dry eye syndrome Lyme disease airway inflammation transplantation rejection graft versus host disease lupus psoriasis scleroderma periodontitis systemic sclerosis coronary artery disease myocarditis atherosclerosis diabetes and inflammation associated with microbial infection e.g. viral protazoal fungal or bacterial infection .

Halofuginone analogs can be useful for treatment of any of these diseases by suppressing the chronic inflammatory activity of IL 17 expressing cells such as IL 17 expressing effector T cells e.g. Th17 cells. In some instances this may address the root cause of the disease e.g. self sustaining inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis in other cases e.g. diabetes periodontitis it may not address the root cause but may ameloriate the symptoms associated with the disease.

IL 17 expressing effector T cells e.g. Th17 cells and their associated cytokine IL 17 provide a broad framework for predicting or diagnosing diseases potentially treatable by halofuginone analogs. Specifically pre clinical fibrosis and or transplant graft rejection could be identified and treated with a halofuginone analog or with a halofuginone analog in combination with other Th17 antagonists. Additionally diseases that are not currently associated with Th17 cell damage and persistence of inflammation may be identified through the measurement of Th17 cell expansion or of increased IL 17 levels e.g. in serum or synovial fluid . Alternatively or in addition the use of gene profiling to characterize sets of genes activated subsequent to Th17 differentiation may allow detection of Th17 affected tissues prior to histological pathologic changes in tissues.

Halofuginone analogs could be used in combination with other agents that act to suppress Th17 development to achieve synergistic therapeutic effects. Current examples of potential synergistic agents would include anti IL 21 antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof retinoic acid or anti IL 6 antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof all of which can reduce Th17 differentiation.

Halofuginone analogs could be used in combination with other agents that act to suppress inflammation and or immunological reactions such as steroids e.g. cortisol hydrocortisone dexamethasone methylprednisolone and or prednisolone non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs e.g. ibuprofen acetominophin aspirin celecoxib valdecoxib etoricoxib lumiracoxib parecoxib rofecoxib nimesulide and or naproxen or immunosuppressants e.g. cyclosporine rapamycin and or FK506 . In certain embodiments halofuginone analogs are used in combination with agents that are immunomodulatory e.g. modulators of the mTOR pathway thalidomide and derivatives thereof such as lenalidomide and actimid biguanides such as metformin phenformin buformin and proguanil and HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A depsipeptide SAHA PXD101 LAQ824 LBH589 MS275 CI994 MGCD0103 and valproic acid. In some embodiments an agent that inhibits a tRNA synthetase is used in combination with an inhibitor of a proinflammatory cytokine. Proinflammatory cytokines that can be targeted in addition to IL 6 and IL 21 discussed above include TNF IFN GM CSF MIP 2 IL 12 IL 1 IL I and IL 23. Examples of such inhibitors include antibodies that bind to the cytokine or that bind to a receptor of the cytokine and block its activity agents that reduce expression of the cytokine e.g. small interfering RNA siRNA or antisense agents soluble cytokine receptors and small molecule inhibitors see e.g. WO 2007 058990 .

In some embodiments agents that inhibit tRNA synthetases are used in combination with an inhibitor of TNF . In some embodiments an inhibitor of TNF comprises an anti TNF antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. In some embodiments the anti TNF antibody is adalimumab Humira . In some embodiments the anti TNF antibody is infliximab Remicade . In some embodiments the anti TNF antibody is CDP571. In some embodiments an inhibitor of TNF comprises a TNF receptor. For example in some embodiments the TNF inhibitor is etanercept Enbrel which is a recombinant fusion protein having two soluble TNF receptors joined by the Fc fragment of a human IgG1 molecule. In some embodiments an inhibitor of TNF comprises an agent that inhibit expression of TNF e.g. such as nucleic acid molecules that mediate RNA interference RNAi e.g. a TNF selective siRNA or shRNA or antisense oligonucleotides. For example a TNF inhibitor can include e.g. a short interfering nucleic acid siNA a short interfering RNA siRNA a double stranded RNA dsRNA or a short hairpin RNA shRNA see e.g. U.S. Patent Application No. 20050227935 incorporated herein by reference .

Halofuginone analogs can be evaluated in animal models. To determine whether a particular halofuginone analog suppresses graft rejection allogeneic or xenogeneic grafting e.g. skin grafting organ transplantion or cell implantation can be performed on an animal such as a rat mouse rabbit guinea pig dog or non human primate. Strains of mice such as C57B1 10 B10.BR and B10.AKM Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor Me. which have the same genetic background but are mismatched for the H 2 locus are well suited for assessing various organ grafts.

In another example heart transplantation is performed e.g. by performing cardiac grafts by anastomosis of the donor heart to the great vessels in the abdomen of the host as described by Ono et al. 57 225 1969. See also Corry et al. 16 343 1973. Function of the transplanted heart can be assessed by palpation of ventricular contractions through the abdominal wall. Rejection is defined as the cessation of myocardial contractions. A halofuginone analog would be considered effective in reducing organ rejection if animals treated with the inhibitor experience a longer period of myocardial contractions of the donor heart than do untreated hosts.

In another example effectiveness of a halofuginone analog at reducing skin graft rejection is assessed in an animal model. To perform skin grafts on a rodent a donor animal is anesthetized and a full thickness skin is removed from a part of the tail. The recipient animal is also anesthetized and a graft bed is prepared by removing a patch of skin e.g. 0.5 0.5 cm from the shaved flank. Donor skin is shaped to fit the graft bed positioned covered with gauze and bandaged. Grafts are inspected daily beginning on the sixth post operative day and are considered rejected when more than half of the transplanted epithelium appears to be non viable. A halofuginone analog that causes a host to experience a longer period of engraftment than seen in an untreated host would be considered effective in this type of experiment.

In another example a halofuginone analog is evaluated in a pancreatic islet cell allograft model. DBA 2J islet cell allografts can be transplanted into rodents such as 6 8 week old B6 AF1 mice rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin 225 mg kg Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis Mo. . As a control syngeneic islet cell grafts can be transplanted into diabetic mice. Islet cell transplantation can be performed by following published protocols for example see Emamaullee et al. 56 5 1289 98 2007 . Allograft function can be followed by serial blood glucose measurements Accu Check III Boehringer Mannheim Germany . A rise in blood glucose exceeding normal levels on each of at least 2 successive days following a period of primary graft function is indicative of graft rejection. The NOD non obese diabetic mouse model is another model that can be used to evaluate ability of a halofuginone analog to treat or prevent type I diabetes.

In another example a tRNA synthetase inhibitor is evaluated in a model of dry eye disease DED . In one such model DED is induced in mice in a controlled environment chamber by administering scopolamine hydrobromide into the skin four times daily. Chamber conditions include a relative humidity 

Numerous autoimmune diseases have been modeled in animals including rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus SLE type I diabetes dry eye syndrome and autoimmune diseases of the thyroid gut and central nervous system. For example animal models of SLE include MRL mice BXSB mice and NZB mice and their F1 hybrids. The general health of the animal as well as the histological appearance of renal tissue can be used to determine whether the administration of a halofuginone analog can effectively suppress the immune response in an animal model of one of these diseases.

Animal models of intestinal inflammation are described for example by Elliott et al. Elliott et al. 1998 Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Celiac Disease. In The Autoimmune Diseases Third ed. N. R. Rose and I. R. MacKay eds. Academic Press San Diego Calif. . Some mice with genetically engineered gene deletions develop chronic bowel inflammation similar to IBD. See e.g. Elson et al. 109 1344 1995 Ludviksson et al. 158 104 1997 and Mombaerts et al. 75 274 1993 . One of the MRL strains of mice that develops SLE MRL lpr lpr also develops a form of arthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis in humans Theofilopoulos et al. 37 269 1985 .

Models of autoimmune disease in the central nervous system CNS such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis EAE can also be experimentally induced e.g. by injection of brain or spinal cord tissue with adjuvant into the animal see e.g. Steinman and Zamvil Ann Neurol. 60 12 21 2006 . In one EAE model C57B 6 mice are injected with an immunodominant peptide of myelin basic protein in Complete Freund s Adjuvant. EAE disease correlates such as limp tail weak altered gait hind limb paralysis forelimb paralysis and morbidity are monitored in animals treated with a halofuginone analog as compared to controls.

In addition to T cell differentiation processes halofuginone analogs can specifically alter processes such as fibrosis and angiogenesis. Fibrosis can be assayed in vitro by observing the effect of a halofuginone analog on fibroblast behavior. In one exemplary assay for use in evaluating halofuginone analogs primary dermal fibroblasts are cultured in a matrix of Type I collagen which mimics the interstitial matrix of the dermis and hypodermis such that fibroblasts attach to the substratum and spread. Inhibition of fibroblast attachment and spreading in the presence of a halofuginone analog indicates that the halofuginone analog has anti fibrotic properties. Biological effects of halofuginone analogs on non immune cell functions can also be evaluated in vivo. In some embodiments a halofuginone analog reduces extracellular matrix deposition e.g. in an animal model of wound healing see e.g. Pines et al. 9 417 425 2003 . In some embodiments a halofuginone analog reduces extracellular matrix deposition at a concentration lower than the concentration at which it inhibits another cellular function such as cell proliferation or protein synthesis.

The invention further provides methods of treating a disease using a halofuginone analog. The inventive method involves the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a halofuginone analog to a subject including but not limited to a human or other animal .

Compounds and compositions described herein are useful for the inhibition of glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase EPRS Inhibition of EPRS leads to the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs which in turn activate the amino acid starvation response AAR . Activation of this response suppresses 1 pro fibrotic gene expression 2 the differentiation of na ve T cells into Th17 cells that promote autoimmunity 3 viral gene expression replication and maturation and or 4 stress to organs e.g. during transplantation .

In some embodiments halofuginone analog that inhibits EPRS has anti fibrotic properties in vivo. For example an EPRS inhibitor halofuginone potently reduces dermal extracellular matrix ECM deposition Pines et al. 9 417 425 2003 . Halofuginone inhibits the transcription of a number of components and modulators of ECM function including Type I collagen fibronectin the matrix metallopeptidases MMP 2 and MMP 9 and the metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP 2 Li et al. 11 3046 3050 2005 Pines et al. 9 417 425 2003 . The major cell types responsible for altered ECM deposition tissue thickening and contracting during fibrosis are fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts mature differentiate from their precursor fibroblasts in response to cytokine release often following tissue damage and mechanical stress and can be distinguished from fibroblasts in a wide range of organs and pathological conditions Border et al. 331 1286 1292 1994 Branton et al. 1 1349 1365 1999 Flanders 85 47 64 2004 . Halofuginone has been studied extensively as a potential anti fibrotic therapeutic and has progressed to phase 2 clinical trials for applications stemming from these properties.

In animal models of wound healing and fibrotic disease halofuginone reduces excess dermal ECM deposition when introduced intraperitoneally added to food or applied locally Pines et al. 9 417 425 2003 . Halofuginone is currently in phase 2 clinical trials as a treatment for scleroderma Pines et al. 9 417 425 2003 bladder cancer Elkin et al. 59 4111 4118 1999 and angiogenesis during Kaposi s sarcoma as well as in earlier stages of clinical investigation for a wide range of other fibrosis associated disorders Nagler et al. 154 1082 1086 1996 Nagler et al. 17 194 202 1997 Nagler et al. 40 1397 1403 2004 Ozcelik et al. 187 257 260 2004 . The results presented herein indicate that the inhibition of fibrosis may be due at least in part to the inhibition of glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase EPRS .

In some embodiments a halofuginone analog inhibits pro fibrotic activities of fibroblasts. Thus in certain embodiments the present invention provides a method for treating a fibroblast associated disorder comprising the step of administering to a patient in need thereof a halofuginone analog or pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof.

As used herein the term fibroblast associated disorders means any disease or other deleterious condition in which fibroblasts are known to play a role. Accordingly another embodiment of the present invention relates to treating or lessening the severity of one or more diseases in which fibroblasts are known to play a role including but not limited to fibrosis.

While halofuginone at high concentrations between 20 40 nM does generally inhibit CD4 T cell CD8 T cell and B220 B cell activation halofuginone also specifically inhibits the development of Th17 cells i.e. the T helper subset that exclusively expresses high levels of the pro inflammatory cytokine interleukin IL 17 at low concentrations PCT US08 09774 filed Aug. 15 2008 which claims priority to U.S. Ser. No. 60 964 936 filed Aug. 15 2007 the entirety of each of which is incorporated herein by reference . Th17 cells as a function of their IL 17 secretion play causal roles in the pathogenesis of two important autoimmune diseases in the mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE and type II collagen induced arthritis CIA . EAE and CIA are murine models of the human autoimmune pathologies multiple sclerosis MS and rheumatoid arthritis RA . Halofuginone has been shown to be active in these models. Halofuginone mediated specific inhibition of IL 17 expressing cell development such as IL 17 expressing effector T cell development e.g. Th17 cell development takes place at remarkably low concentrations with 50 inhibition being achieved around 3 nM. Therefore halofuginone treatment specifically inhibits the development of Th17 mediated and or IL 17 related diseases including autoimmune diseases persistent inflammatory diseases and infectious diseases while not leading to profound T cell dysfunction either in the context of delayed type hypersensitivity or infection. Halofuginone analogs can also be used to inhibit the development of Th17 mediated and or IL 17 related diseases.

Halofuginone and analogs thereof interfere with the differentiation of na ve T cells into IL 17 expressing Th17 cells. Thus in certain embodiments the present invention provides a method for treating a Th17 mediated or IL 17 mediated disorder comprising the step of administering to a patient in need thereof a halofuginone analog or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof.

As used herein the terms Th17 mediated disorder and IL 17 mediated disorder means any disease or other deleterious condition in which Th17 or IL 17 is known to play a role. Accordingly another embodiment of the present invention relates to treating or lessening the severity of one or more diseases in which Th17 or IL 17 is known to play a role including but not limited to autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases infectious diseases angiogenesis and organ protection during transplantation.

Halofuginone analogs and pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be administered to animals preferably mammals e.g. domesticated animals cats dogs mice rats and more preferably humans. Any method of administration may be used to deliver the agent or pharmaceutical composition to the animal. In certain embodiments the agent or pharmaceutical composition is administered orally.

Liquid dosage forms for oral and parenteral administration include but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions microemulsions solutions suspensions syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active agents the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as for example water or other solvents solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol isopropyl alcohol ethyl carbonate ethyl acetate benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate propylene glycol 1 3 butylene glycol dimethylformamide oils in particular cottonseed groundnut corn germ olive castor and sesame oils glycerol tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof.

Injectable preparations for example sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. Sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water Ringer s solution U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.

Injectable formulations can be sterilized for example by filtration through a bacterial retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.

In order to prolong the effect of a drug it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as poly lactide co glycolide . Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.

Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active agent.

Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules tablets pills powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms the active agent is mixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and or a fillers or extenders such as starches lactose sucrose glucose mannitol and silicic acid b binders such as for example carboxymethylcellulose alginates gelatin polyvinylpyrrolidinone sucrose and acacia c humectants such as glycerol d disintegrating agents such as agar agar calcium carbonate potato or tapioca starch alginic acid certain silicates and sodium carbonate e solution retarding agents such as paraffin f absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds g wetting agents such as for example cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate h absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i lubricants such as talc calcium stearate magnesium stearate solid polyethylene glycols sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules tablets and pills the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.

Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets dragees capsules pills and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient s only or preferentially in a certain part of the intestinal tract optionally in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.

Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi liquid preparations such as liniments lotions gels applicants oil in water or water in oil emulsions such as creams ointments or pastes or solutions or suspensions such as drops. Formulations for topical administration to the skin surface can be prepared by dispersing the drug with a dermatologically acceptable carrier such as a lotion cream ointment or soap. Useful carriers are capable of forming a film or layer over the skin to localize application and inhibit removal. For topical administration to internal tissue surfaces the agent can be dispersed in a liquid tissue adhesive or other substance known to enhance adsorption to a tissue surface. For example hydroxypropylcellulose or fibrinogen thrombin solutions can be used to advantage. Alternatively tissue coating solutions such as pectin containing formulations can be used. Ophthalmic formulation ear drops and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of an agent to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the agent in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the agent across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the agent in a polymer matrix or gel.

In various embodiments of the invention suitable in vitro or in vivo studies are performed to determine whether administration of a specific therapeutic that modulates the development of IL 17 expressing cells such as IL 17 expressing effector T cells e.g. Th17 cells is indicated for treatment of a given subject or population of subjects. For example subjects in need of treatment using a compound that modulates IL 17 expressing cell development such as IL 17 expressing effector T cell development e.g. Th17 cell development are identified by obtaining a sample of IL 17 expressing cells such as IL 17 expressing effector T cells e.g. Th17 cells from a given test subject and expanding the sample of cells. If the concentration of any of a variety of inflammatory cytokine markers including IL 17 IL 17F IL 6 IL 21 IL 2 and TNF also increases as the cell population expands then the test subject is a candidate for treatment using any of the compounds compositions and methods described herein.

Subjects in need of treatment are also identified by detecting an elevated level of IL 17 expressing cells such as IL 17 expressing effector T cells e.g. Th17 cells or a Th17 cell associated cytokine or a cytokine that is secreted by a Th17 cell. Cytokine levels to be evaluated include IL 17 IL 17F IL 6 IL 21 TNF and GM CSF. The cytokine IL 17 as well as other cytokines such as IL 6 IL 21 IL 2 TNF and GM CSF are typically induced during inflammation and or infection. Thus any elevated level of expression of these cytokines in a subject or biological sample as compared to the level of expression of these cytokines in a normal subject is useful as an indicator of a disease state or other situation where treatment with an inventive compound is desirable. Studies have shown that the levels of IL 17 in healthy patient serum is less than 2 pg mL i.e. below the detection limit of the assay used while patients with liver injury had levels of IL 17 expression in the range of 2 18 pg mL and patients with rheumatoid arthritis had levels greater than 100 pg mL see Yasumi et al. . 2007 37 248 254 and Ziolkowska et al. . 2000 164 2832 2838 each of which is incorporated herein by reference . Thus detection of an expression level of IL 17 greater than 2 pg mL in a subject or biological sample is useful in identifying subjects in need of treatment.

A subject suffering from or at risk of developing a Th17 related and or IL 17 related diseases such as an autoimmune disease a persistent inflammatory disease or an infectious disease is identified by methods known in the art. For example subjects suffering from an autoimmune disease persistent inflammatory disease or an infectious disease are diagnosed based on the presence of one or more symptoms associated with a given autoimmune persistent inflammatory or infectious disease. Common symptoms include for example inflammation fever loss of appetite weight loss abdominal symptoms such as for example abdominal pain diarrhea or constipation joint pain or aches arthralgia fatigue rash anemia extreme sensitivity to cold Raynaud s phenomenon muscle weakness muscle fatigue change in skin or tissue tone shortness of breath or other abnormal breathing patterns chest pain or constriction of the chest muscles abnormal heart rate e.g. elevated or lowered light sensitivity blurry or otherwise abnormal vision and reduced organ function.

Subjects suffering from an autoimmune disease such as e.g. multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis Crohn s diseases are identified using any of a variety of clinical and or laboratory test such as physical examination radiological examination and blood urine and stool analysis to evaluate immune status. For example subjects suffering from an infectious disease such as Lyme disease are identified based on symptoms objective physical findings such as erythema migrans facial palsy or arthritis and a history of possible exposure to infected ticks. Blood test results are generally used to confirm a diagnosis of Lyme disease.

In various embodiments of the invention suitable in vitro or in vivo studies are performed to determine the effect of a specific therapeutic that modulates the development of IL 17 expressing cells such as IL 17 expressing effector T cells e.g. Th17 cells and whether its administration is indicated for treatment of a given subject or population of subjects. For example the biological effect of a selective Th17 inhibitor therapeutic such as a compound of the invention is monitored by measuring level of IL 17 production and or the number of IL 17 expressing cells such as IL 17 expressing effector T cells e.g. Th17 cells in a patient derived sample. The biological effect of a therapeutic is also measured by physical and or clinical observation of a patient suffering from or at risk of developing a Th17 related and or Il 17 related disease such as an autoimmune disease persistent inflammatory disease and or an infectious disease. For example administration of a specific Th17 inhibitor to a patient suffering from a Th17 related disease and or an IL 17 related disease is considered successful if one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder is alleviated reduced inhibited or does not progress to a further i.e. worse state.

These and other aspects of the present invention will be further appreciated upon consideration of the following Examples which are intended to illustrate certain particular embodiments of the invention but are not intended to limit its scope as defined by the claims.

SV MES mesangial cells were stimulated for 2 hours with halofuginone 20 nM or an inactive derivative of halofuginone 9 MAZ1310 20 nM or control buffer lysed and analyzed by SDS PAGE Western blot for total or Ser51 phosphorylated eIF2alpha and total or Thr 898 phosphorylated GCN2. shows the results of the experiment. Duplicate cell samples are shown. Phosphorylation of GCN2 at Thr898 is a defining characteristic of AAR activation therefore the activation of GCN2 phosphorylation at this site following HF treatment indicates that HF activates the AAR. Activated GCN2 phosphorylates eif2alpha at Ser 51 therefore this is an expected downstream outcome of AAR activation.

CD4 CD25 T cells purified from wild type of GCN2 mice were activated through TCR for 4 hours in the presence of halofuginone 10 nM or 9 MAZ1310 10 nM . Results are shown in . Whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS PAGE Western blot and antibodies indicated. Treatment with Halofuginone but not the inactive derivative 9 leads to phosphorylation of Ser51 of eif2alpha only in wild type cells and not in GCN2 cells establishing the eif2alpha phosphorylation following halofuginone stimulation occurs through activation of the AAR GCN2 pathway.

Translation in vitro was performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysates and luciferase mRNA as template. Translation was measured as arbitrary units of luciferase activity using a luminometer based luminescence assay. Results are shown in . Log scale presentation of background subtracted data is shown. Translations were performed without dark bars or with light bars 400 nM halofuginone in the absence of amino acids 0 or with the following additions Mix 1 1 mM Asn 1 mM Arg Mix 2 1 mM Lys 1 mM Ile 1 mM Tyr Mix 3 1 mM His 1 mM Met 1 mM Leu Mix 4 1 mM Ser 1 mM Phe 1 mM Pro Phe 2 mM Phe Pro 2 mM Pro Ser 2 mM Ser. Addition of proline either alone or in combination with phenylaline and serine rescues inhibition of translation by halofuginone establishing that proline utilization for translation by glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase is the critical target of halofuginone action.

Na ve T cells were treated to stimulate the T cell receptor TCR in the presence or absence of 10 nM halofuginone in the presence of 1 mM added amino acid and then assayed for eIF2alpha activity phosphorylation by SDS PAGE Western blot. Results are shown in . Phosphorylation induced by halofuginone is blocked by added proline. These data establish that utilization of proline is inhibited by halofuginone leading to activation of the AAR.

Na ve T cells were stimulated to differentiate in the presence or absence of 10 nM halofuginone with 1 mM of the indicated amino acids added to the medium and stained for Th17 differentiation on day 4. Results are shown in . Na ve murine T cells were activated in the presence or absence of TGF plus IL 6 as indicated expanded in for 4 days and restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for intracellular cytokine staining. For intracellular cytokine staining fixed cells were washed twice with staining buffer PBS 1 BSA 0.1 NaN and then permeabilized with perm buffer III BD Pharmingen on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed and stored in staining buffer prior to data acquisition All FACS data was acquired on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer BD Pharmingen and analyzed using FlowJo software Treestar Inc. Ashland Oreg. . FACS sorting was performed on a FACS Diva cytometer BD Pharmingen . Bars indicate percentage of cells differentiation as Th17 as indicated by IL17 expression. Proline and no other added amino acid rescues the inhibition of Th17 differentiation by halofuginone confirming that proline utilization is the critical target for halofuginone inhibition of Th17 differentiation.

The ability of halofuginone and analogs thereof to inhibit the spreading of freshly plated primary dermal fibroblasts was examined. Human primary dermal fibroblasts were replated and halofuginone added immediately after replating spreading of cells was assessed by light microscopy 28 hours after treatment with compound. vs. vs. in general denotes 4 fold differences in potency. denotes no activity at any dose tested up to 1000 the effective dose of halofuginone. These data establish that several analogs of halofuginone act similarly to halofuginone in this assay and that these activities correlate well with activities described in Tables 2 and 3 below.

The effect of different halofuginone and analogs thereof on differentiation of na ve T cells was assayed as described in legend for above. Differentiation of primary na ve T cells into Th17 cells following T cell receptor stimulation IL 6 TGFb. vs. vs. in general denotes 4 fold differences in potency. denotes no activity at any dose tested up to 1000 the effective dose of halofuginone. These data establish that several analogs of halofuginone act similarly to halofuginone in this assay.

Inhibition of translation of luciferase RNA by halofuginone and analogs thereof was measured as described in above. Results are shown of translation of a luciferase RNA reporter in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. vs. vs. in general denotes 4 fold differences in potency. denotes no activity at any dose tested up to 1000 the effective dose of halofuginone. These data establish that several analogs of halofuginone act similarly to halofuginone in this assay and that these activities correlate well with activities described in Tables 1 and 2 above.

This example shows that the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase inhibitor halofuginone HF imparts a selective block of Th17 differentiation in both human and mouse T cells by inducing the AAR response.

To investigate whether HF can modulate T cell differentiation or effector function purified murine CD4 CD25 T cells were treated with HF or its inactive derivative 9 MAZ1310 and stimulated in the absence or presence of polarizing cytokines to induce Th1 Th2 iTreg or Th17 differentiation. Dose response experiments revealed a remarkably selective effect of HF on Th17 differentiation defined here as the percentage of IL 17 IFN cells following restimulation on day 4 5 . HF repressed Th17 differentiation in a dose dependent manner with an ICof 3.6 nM 0.4 nM B . Low concentrations of HF 1 10 nM that strongly reduced IL 17 production B did not affect T cell proliferation CD25 upregulation or production of IL 2 TNF or IFN . Low dose HF also failed to modulate Th1 Th2 or iTreg differentiation as assessed by IFN IL 4 or Foxp3 expression respectively . At approximately 10 fold higher concentrations 20 nM HF induced a general inhibition of T and B cell activation proliferation and effector function B .

The selective inhibition of Th17 differentiation by low dose HF was stereospecific the HPLC purified D enantiomer of HF inhibited IL 17 expression more potently than a racemic mixture whereas the L enantiomer was completely inactive . Inhibition of IL 17 expression was most pronounced when HF was added during a 12 hour window at the start of the culture period and HF treatment impaired expression of both IL 17 and IL 17f mRNA . These results suggest that HF regulates early events possibly involved in Th17 lineage commitment rather than influencing the expansion of Th17 cells or preventing acute cytokine expression upon restimulation. Inhibition by HF was not due to perturbation of cell cycle progression or selective survival HF inhibited IL 17 expression in a dose dependent manner even when considering only cells that had completed an equivalent number of cell divisions based on CFSE dilution . HF also reduced IL 17 expression in cultures where IFN and IL 4 cytokines known to inhibit Th17 differentiation Park et al. Nat. Immunol. 6 1133 2005 were blocked by addition of neutralizing antibodies. Thus HF mediated inhibition of Th17 cell development is not secondary to effects on T cell proliferation or auxiliary cytokine production.

In light of reports that IL 17 expression may be differentially regulated in murine versus human T cells Manel et al. 9 641 2008 Wilson et al. Nat. Immunol. 8 950 2007 Acosta Rodriguez et al. 8 942 2007 HF modulation of IL 17 expression by human CD4 T cells was investigated. These experiments showed that HF treatment greatly reduced both the percentage of human T cells expressing IL 17 and the amount of IL 17 produced G . In striking contrast IFN expression was essentially unaffected by HF treatment G . Therefore HF selectively limits IL 17 expression in both human and mouse T cells.

Th17 differentiation is synergistically regulated by TGF and the pro inflammatory cytokines IL 6 and IL 21. Although reports had indicated that HF can attenuate TGF signaling at high concentrations 50 nM Gnainsky et al. 328 153 200 Flanders 85 47 2004 it was discovered that low dose HF inhibited neither TGF induced Smad phosphorylation nor a variety of other lymphocyte responses to TGF Li et al. 24 99 2006 Glimcher et al. 4 900 2004 van Vlasselaer et al. 148 2062 1992 in contrast to the type 1 TGF receptor kinase inhibitor SB 431542 which abrogated all responses to TGF . Since STAT3 is the major transducer of IL 6 and IL 21 signaling the kinetics of STAT3 phosphorylation in HF treated T cells were examined. HF did not interfere with STAT3 activation during the first 6 hours of Th17 differentiation but rather decreased the maintenance of STAT3 phosphorylation beginning around 12 hours post activation B .

Next it was investigated whether inhibition of Th17 differentiation by HF could be restored by transgenic expression of a hyperactive STAT3 protein STAT3C Bromberg et al. 98 295 1999 . T cells isolated from homozygous mice containing a floxed stop STAT3C IRES EGFP STAT3C GFPfl fl or stop YFP YFPfl fl cassette inserted into the ROSA26 locus were transduced with a cell permeant TAT Cre fusion protein to delete the stop cassette and these cells were activated in the presence of TGF plus IL 6 with either HF or 9 MAZ1310 . As expected HF strongly impaired Th17 differentiation of cells expressing YFP or those not expressing a transgene top three panels in contrast T cells expressing STAT3C defined by their concomitant expression of GFP remained capable of differentiating into Th17 cells even in the presence of 10 nM HF bottom panel . Data from a number of similar experiments are quantified and summarized in . Collectively these results suggest that HF inhibits Th17 differentiation through its ability to prevent sustained activation of STAT3. STAT3 promotes Th17 lineage commitment through the induction of the orphan nuclear receptors ROR t and ROR Yang et al. 282 9358 2007 Ivanov et al. 126 1121 2006 Yang et al. 28 29 2008 . Consistent with the finding that HF did not affect STAT3 phosphorylation during the first 12 hours of stimulation HF did not interfere with the upregulation of ROR t or ROR during Th17 differentiation . Moreover HF inhibited Th17 differentiation as effectively in T cells retrovirally transduced with ROR t expressing retroviruses as in those transduced with empty retroviruses C . T cells differentiated in the presence of HF showed enhanced Foxp3 expression as expected from the observations that HF inhibits STAT3 signaling and Th17 differentiation Yang et al. 282 9358 2007 . This result suggested that HF redirects developing Th17 cells to the iTreg lineage rather than simply blocking their effector function. However upregulation of Foxp3 by HF was neither necessary nor sufficient to inhibit Th17 differentiation retroviral expression of FOXP3 in T cells did not decrease IL 17 expression induced by TGF plus IL 6 though it markedly reduced IL 2 and IFN production in T cells cultured under non polarizing conditions. Moreover HF strongly repressed IL 17 expression in T cells lacking Foxp3 . Therefore the inhibitory effects of HF on Th17 differentiation are not exerted indirectly through the upregulation of Foxp3. Rather HF impairs the maintenance of STAT3 phosphorylation in developing Th17 cells resulting in a reciprocal increase in iTreg cell development.

The 12 hour lag period between the addition of HF to T cell cultures and the ensuing effect on STAT3 phosphorylation strongly suggested an indirect effect. To identify more proximal cellular effects of HF treatment we used DNA microarrays to define the transcriptional profiles of HF and MAZ 1310 treated T cells activated in Th17 priming conditions for 3 or 6 hours. Eighty one annotated genes that were differentially expressed at both time points in HF versus MAZ1310 treated cells were identified the majority of which were upregulated following HF treatment . Among the HF inducible transcripts a large number of genes functionally associated with amino acid synthesis and transport as well as protein synthesis were observed . Similar gene expression profiles have been observed during cellular responses to amino acid starvation Fafournoux et al. 351 1 2000 Peng et al. 22 5575 2002 . Insufficient cellular levels of amino acids lead to the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs that in turn activate the amino acid response AAR pathway via the protein kinase GCN2. Activated GCN2 phosphorylates and inhibits eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A eIF2 thereby reducing overall protein translation while specifically enhancing translation of the transcription factor ATF4 Harding et al. 11 619 2003 Harding et al. 6 1099 2000 . Indeed a number of stress induced genes reportedly regulated by ATF4 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts Harding et al. 11 619 2003 were over represented among the genes induced by HF treatment in T cells . These analyses suggest that at least a portion of the transcriptional response to HF is mediated by ATF4. Furthermore quantitative real time PCR qPCR experiments confirmed that at least three known AAR associated genes Asns Gpt2 eIF4Ebp1 were induced by HF treatment within 4 hours of T cell activation .

To directly address whether HF activates the AAR pathway eIF2 phosphorylation and ATF4 protein levels in HF treated T cells was examined. HF induced detectable eIF2 phosphorylation at 2.5 nM and this effect plateaued at 5 10 nM HF . ATF4 expression levels were highest in T cells treated with 5 10 nM HF and were reduced in cells treated with higher concentrations of HF 20 40 nM demonstrating a positive correlation between the concentrations of HF that induce ATF4 expression and those that selectively inhibit Th17 differentiation . In kinetic analyses eIF2 phosphorylation in HF treated cells reached maximum levels by 2 hours and ATF4 protein continued to accumulate until 4 hours indicating that HF activates the AAR pathway before any detectable effects on STAT3 phosphorylation or IL 17 production are observed. AAR activation was a general consequence of HF treatment HF induced eIF2 phosphorylation not only in T cells activated in Th17 priming conditions but also in resting na ve T cells and T cells activated in ThN Th1 Th2 and iTreg polarizing conditions . HF treatment also increased eIF2 phosphorylation in cultured fibroblasts and microarray analyses of fibroblasts revealed that HF induced a pattern of early gene induction similar to that seen in T cells. These data demonstrate that activation of the AAR pathway by HF is not a cell type specific effect. HF treatment induced ATF4 expression in all differentiated T cells but not in na ve T cells . This result most likely reflects the low metabolic rate and relatively inefficient translation capacity of na ve T cells Rathmell et al. 33 2223 2003 . Thus the rapid activation of the AAR pathway by HF could underlie both its selective inhibition of Th17 differentiation and its effects on fibroblasts Pines and Nagler 30 445 1998 .

A variety of other cellular stresses ER stress oxidative stress viral infection also result in eIF2 phosphorylation and ATF4 translation a phenomenon termed the integrated stress response ISR Harding et al. 11 619 2003 Harding et al. 6 1099 2000 . Individual stressors however can also activate stress type specific pathways. For instance the unfolded protein response UPR which is activated by ER stress results in expression of the transcription factor Xbp 1 through a mechanism involving IRE 1 dependent splicing as well as nuclear translocation of the ER sequestered transcription factor ATF6 in addition to eIF2 phosphorylation catalyzed by the protein kinase Perk Ron and Walter 8 519 2007 Brunsing et al. 283 17954 2008 Lin et al. 318 944 2007 . Xbp 1 and ATF6 in turn upregulate ER chaperones such as GRP78 BiP and calreticulin whose expression is specific to the UPR and independent of the eIF2 ATF4 ISR pathway Ron and Walter 8 519 2007 Lee et al. 23 7448 2003 . However HF did not induce the expression of these and other hallmark ER stress response genes.

To delineate the stress response pathway activated by HF the effects of amino acid starvation with those of tunicamycin an inducer of ER stress or HF treatment during T cell activation were compared. As expected cells deprived of cysteine Cys and methionine Met displayed eIF2 phosphorylation ATF4 expression and upregulation of AAR associated genes but did not induce Xbp 1 splicing B . In contrast tunicamycin treatment induced eIF2 phosphorylation and ATF4 expression together with Xbp 1 splicing as characteristic of the UPR. The effects of HF treatment closely resembled those of amino acid starvation inducing eIF2 phosphorylation without promoting Xbp 1 splicing . Taken together these data indicate that HF specifically induces an AAR.

Next the effects of amino acid starvation on Th17 differentiation and STAT3 activation were investigated. It was discovered that the functional consequences of Cys Met deprivation were remarkably similar to those of HF treatment in T cells. Cys Met deprivation profoundly and selectively impaired Th17 differentiation in a manner directly related to the concentration of these amino acids in the culture medium. T cells cultured under limiting Cys Met concentrations showed greatly diminished Th17 differentiation but upregulated CD25 expression and differentiated into Th1 Th2 and iTreg subsets as effectively as T cells cultured in complete medium . As shown for HF inhibition of IL 17 expression by amino acid starvation was unrelated to cell survival or proliferation . Further similar to the effects of HF Cys Met deprivation did not affect the early phase of STAT3 phosphorylation but impaired the maintenance of STAT3 phosphorylation D . Moreover L tryptophanol a tryptophan derivative that competitively inhibits tryptophanyl tRNA loading or limiting concentrations of a different amino acid leucine also impaired IL 17 production suggesting that inhibition of Th17 differentiation is a general consequence of amino acid starvation. The mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR pathway represents a second complementary mechanism through which cells respond to amino acid availability Fingar and Blenis 23 3151 2004 . However early transcriptional responses induced by HF and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin are distinct Peng et al. 22 5575 2002 and and HF did not inhibit signaling downstream of mTOR in fibroblasts.

To test whether inhibition of IL 17 expression was specific to stress induced by amino acid starvation the influence of tunicamycin on T cell activation and differentiation was tested. Surprisingly low concentrations of tunicamycin had little influence on IL 17 expression in T cells but instead preferentially impaired Th1 and Th2 differentiation . These data suggest that individual stress response pathways can regulate distinct aspects of T cell differentiation and effector function but also indicate that eIF2 phosphorylation and ATF4 translation shared consequences of both AAR and UPR are not sufficient to explain the selective regulation of Th17 differentiation by HF or amino acid deprivation. The impact of cellular stress on the immune system is complex. Data herein show here that Th17 differentiation is particularly susceptible to stress induced by amino acid deprivation whereas ER stress blunts Th1 and Th2 differentiation. In addition to these effects on T cell effector function eIF2 phosphorylation induced during ER stress may have cytoprotective effects in oligodendrocytes and pancreatic cells during acute inflammation associated with autoimmune encephalomyelitis and diabetes Puccetti and Grohmann 7 817 2007 Lin et al. 117 448 2007 . Diverse cellular responses to stress may regulate both T cell function and the downstream cellular targets of inflammatory cytokine signaling during tissue inflammation.

The distinctive sensitivity of Th17 cells to AAR pathway activation may have a role during adaptive immune responses in vivo. For example indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase IDO an IFN induced enzyme that breaks down tryptophan has been shown to cause local depletion of tryptophan at sites of inflammation and activate the AAR pathway in resident T cells Puccetti and Grohmann 7 817 2007 Munn et al. 22 633 2005 . While local IDO accumulation is most often associated with proliferative impairment in T cells expansion or conversion of Foxp3 T cells also has been reported following upregulation of IDO Puccetti and Grohmann 7 817 2007 Park et al. 10 R11 2008 . Given the reciprocal relationship between the development of pro inflammatory Th17 cells and tissue protective iTreg cells it is postulated that IDO mediated immune tolerance involves local AAR mediated inhibition of Th17 differentiation and consequent skewing of the Th17 iTreg balance in favor of iTreg cells Romani et al. 180 5157 2008 .

The ability of systemic HF treatment to block IL 17 expression and associated autoimmune inflammation in vivo was examined using two distinct models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE . The first model used is referred to as adjuvant driven EAE and is actively induced by immunization of wild type mice with the immunodominant myelin derived peptide antigen MOGemulsified in Complete Freund s Adjuvant CFA . The second model a passive model of EAE induction is initiated by the transfer of myelin proteolipid protein PLP reactive T cells into lymphopenic hosts.

Adjuvant driven EAE was induced in 8 week old wild type B6 mice purchased from Charles River laboratories Kingston N.Y. by subcutaneous injection of MOGpeptide emulsified in Incomplete Freund s Adjuvant IFA plus 5 mg ml heat killed BD Biosciences in both dorsal flanks as described in Veldhoen et al. 7 11 1151 1156 2006 .

Passive EAE was induced by intravenous transfer of purified CD3 splenic T cells isolated from PLP TCR transgenic B10.S mice into syngeneic RAG2 deficient mice 3 10cells mouse Waldner et al. 113 7 990 997 2004 .

Mice were injected daily with HF 2 g mouse or vehicle control DMSO i.p. Clinical signs of EAE were assessed according to the following score 0 no signs of disease 1 flaccid tail 2 weak gait hind limb paresis 3 hind limb paralysis 4 tetraplegia 5 moribund. Cytokine production during EAE was determined either in peripheral T cells isolated from spleen or lymph nodes of mice prior to disease onset day 6 10 or in mononuclear cells isolated from the brain and spinal cords of mice with severe disease clinical score 2 between days 15 20. Briefly splenocytes were stained for intracellular cytokines following erythrocyte lysis with ammonium chloride buffer. T cells were isolated from brain and spinal cords of mice with active EAE following perfusion with cold PBS. Minced CNS tissue was digested with liberase C1 0.33 mg ml Roche Diagnostics or collagenase D 10 mg ml Roche Diagnostics at 37 C. for 30 45 minutes. Cell suspensions were passed through 70 m cell strainers VWR and fractionated by 70 30 Percoll gradient centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were collected from the interphase washed and used for intracellular cytokine analysis.

The adjuvant driven EAE model is associated with infiltration of both IL 17 and IFN expressing CD4 T cells into the CNS . Low dose HF treatment 2 g HF daily 0.1 mg kg significantly reduced both the severity of adjuvant driven EAE disease and frequency of disease onset . The second passive model of EAE induction leads to a predominant Th1 response rather than Th17 response within CNS infiltrates . In marked contrast to the adjuvant driven EAE model HF treated mice in the passive EAE model developed disease symptoms with kinetics and severity similar to control treated animals . The contrasting effects of HF in these two models of EAE support the notion that HF selectively inhibits IL 17 associated inflammatory T cell function without inducing general T cell hyporesponsiveness. Taken together these data suggest that HF can modulate autoimmune inflammation associated with Th17 but not Th1 responses.

HF mediated protection from adjuvant driven EAE was accompanied by a reduction in T cell derived IL 17 expression both in peripheral lymph nodes prior to disease onset and in CNS tissue during active disease as well as an overall reduction in CD4 T cell infiltrates into the CNS . Consistent with in vitro results HF impaired IL 17 production but did not affect IFN expression in the same T cell populations. Moreover splenocytes isolated ex vivo from HF injected mice displayed increased eIF2 phosphorylation and expression of AAR associated transcripts . Thus systemic administration of low doses of HF activates the AAR leading to a selective impairment of Th17 differentiation and concomitant blunting of IL 17 associated inflammatory responses in vivo.

Thus consistent with in vitro data it was discovered that HF protects mice from adjuvant driven EAE through in vivo activation of the AAR. HF selectively reduced the number of IL 17 expressing T cells in vivo but had no effect on the number of IFN T cells. These data are consistent with reports showing that adjuvant driven EAE disease is particularly sensitive to modulation of IL 17 expression. Notably HF had no effect on an independent passive model of EAE that develops in the absence of a Th17 response demonstrating that HF is neither globally immunosuppressive nor generically protective against CNS inflammation. Both Th1 and Th17 cells can drive EAE pathogenesis when transferred into mice. In the adjuvant driven EAE model described above a roughly equal induction of Th1 and Th17 cells was observed whereas in the passive model of EAE encephalitogenic T cells were biased towards a Th1 response. Thus the lack of an effect of HF in the passive model in comparison to the adjuvant driven EAE is likely due to the distinctive inflammatory T cell responses in the two models.

Two follow on experiments were performed to further determine the therapeutic benefit of HF on EAE. In one HF was injected into mice immunized to produce EAE as described above with the exception that HF was not introduced into the animals until day 10 following immunization. These data demonstrate that HF controls autoimmune inflammation even after inflammatory pathogenesis is evident providing a more accurate representation of autoimmune disease in humans. See . In the other experiment HF was injected into mice immunized to produce EAE as described above with the exception that HF injection was terminated at day 10 following immunization. These data as shown in demonstrate that HF exerts a protective effect that extends well beyond the time of treatment consistent with its proposed role in preventing the differentiation of pro inflammatory Th17 cells. Therefore HF has been shown to have a therapeutic benefit in EAE after the onset of symptoms as well as to prevent the development of the symptoms of EAE.

Two novel derivatives of halofuginone MAZ1320 and MAZ 1686 shown below selectively inhibit the differentiation of Th17 cells without inhibiting Th1 differentiation. Methods for determining Th17 differentiation and FACS analysis are described above. Shown in is FACS analysis of CD4 CD25 T cells analyzed according to IL17 expression marking Th17 differentiation y axis and Th1 IFNgamma x axis following differentiation in the presence of the indicated concentrations of HF or derivatives thereof MAZ1320 MAZ1685 MAZ1686 .

Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was incubated with total bovine tRNA 0.1 M puromycin to prevent translation and C labeled proline or S labeled methionine for minutes in the presence or absence of HF or MAZ1310 an inactive HF derivative . Total RNA was extracted with acidic phenol chloroform and tRNA was isolated using miRVANA microRNA isolation kit. Radioisotope incorporation into tRNA was measured in a scintillation counter. shows data normalized to control no HF or MAZ1310 addition material. HF is an inhibitor of prolyl tRNA synthetase EPRS but not a different tRNA synthetase methionyl tRNA synthetase in a crude in vitro translation system.

Prolyl tRNA synthetase EPRS purified from rabbit liver was tested for its ability to incorporate C labeled proline into tRNA in the presence of the indicated concentration of HF or its inactive derivative MAZ1310. Purified enzyme was incubated with 100 g ml bovine tRNA 50 M C labeled proline 5 mM ATP and 10 mM MgClfor 20 minutes. Charged tRNA was isolated by precipitation on Whatman filter paper and washing with cold 5 TCA. TCA precipitable counts were assayed by scintillation counting. shows the TCA preciptiable counts for 10 M HF 4 M HF 1 M HF and MAZ1310. HF directly inhibits purified mammalian EPRS.

Borrelidin a threonyl tRNA synthetase inhibitor structurally unrelated to HF was tested for its ability to alter T cell differentiation. Methods for determining Th17 differentiation and FACS analysis are described above. Shown in is FACS analysis of CD4 CD25 T cells analyzed according to IL17 expression marking Th17 differentiation IFNgamma expression marking Th1 differentiation FoxP3 expression marking Tref differentiation or IL4 marking Th2 differentiation following differentiation under conditions for polarization of each effector T cell subtype in the presence of the indicated concentrations of HF 10 nM or borrelidin. Borrelidin inhibits Th17 differentiation without affecting Th1 Th2 or Treg differentiation or cell number a selectivity identical to that of HF. tRNA synthetase inhibition therefore provides a general approach to the selective inhibition of Th17 differentiation without generalized immunosuppression.
