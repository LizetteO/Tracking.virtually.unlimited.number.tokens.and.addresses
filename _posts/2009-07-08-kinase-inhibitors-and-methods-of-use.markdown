The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases including numerous forms of cancer inflammatory disorders metabolic disorders vascular and neuronal diseases Gaestel et al. 2007 14 2214 2234 .

Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and or themselves i.e. autophosphorylation . Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues e.g. erb2 PDGF receptor EGF receptor VEGF receptor src abl serine threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and or threonine residues e.g. mTorC1 mTorC2 ATM ATR DNA PK Akt and dual specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine serine and or threonine residues.

Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids within cells. These enzymes and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid derived biologically active organic molecules play a role in many different physiological processes including cell proliferation migration adhesion and differentiation. A particular group of lipid kinases comprises membrane lipid kinases i.e. kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphinositide s kinases such as PI3 kinases PI4 Kinases diacylglycerol kinases and sphingosine kinases.

The phosphoinositide 3 kinases PI3Ks signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is involved in many other disease states including allergic contact dermatitis rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis inflammatory bowel diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder psoriasis multiple sclerosis asthma disorders related to diabetic complications and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.

PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3 OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities expression patterns and modes of regulation Katso et al. 2001 . The class I PI3Ks p110 p110 p110 and p110 are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3 which engages downstream effectors such as the Akt PDK1 pathway mTOR the Tec family kinases and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3 Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI 3 P and PI 3 4 P2.

The production of phosphatidylinositol 3 4 5 trisphosphate initiates potent growth and survival signals. In some epithelial cancers the PI3K pathway is activated by direct genetic mutation. Additionally the PI3K signaling pathway appears to be a crucial survival and growth signal in a broad spectrum of cancers. As PI3K signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and differentiation inhibition of this pathway is believed to be beneficial in hyperproliferative diseases.

Downstream mediators of the PI3K signal transduction pathway include Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR . Akt possesses a pleckstrin homology PH domain that binds PIP3 leading to Akt kinase activation. Akt phosphorylates many substrates and is a central downstream effector of PI3K for diverse cellular responses. Full activation of Akt typically requires phosphorylation of T308 in the activation loop and S473 in a hydrophobic motif. One important function of Akt is to augment the activity of mTOR through phosphorylation of TSC2 and other mechanisms.

mTOR is a serine threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the PI3K family. mTOR has been implicated in a wide range of biological processes including cell growth cell proliferation cell motility and survival. Disregulation of the mTOR pathway has been reported in various types of cancer. mTOR is a multifunctional kinase that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals to regulate protein translation nutrient uptake autophagy and mitrochondrial function.

mTOR exists in two complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 contains the raptor subunit and mTORC2 contains rictor. These complexes are differentially regulated and have distinct substrate specificities and rapamycin sensitivity. For example mTORC1 phosphorylates S6 kinase S6K and 4EBP1 promoting increased translation and ribosome biogenesis to facilitate cell growth and cell cycle progression. S6K also acts in a feedback pathway to attenuate PI3K Akt activation. mTORC2 is generally insensitive to rapamycin. mTORC2 is though to modulate growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C terminal hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases such as Akt. In many cellular contexts mTORC2 is required for phosphorylation of the S473 site of Akt.

Dysregulation of signaling pathways mediated by many other kinases is a key factor in the development of human diseases. Aberrant or excessive protein kinase activity or expression has been observed in many disease states including benign and malignant proliferative diseases disorders such as allergic contact dermatitis rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis inflammatory bowel diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder psoriasis multiple sclerosis asthma disorders related to diabetic complications and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.

As such kinases particularly protein kinases such as mTor and lipid kinases such as PI3Ks are prime targets for drug development. The present invention addresses a need in the art by providing a new class of kinase inhibitors and various treatment methods.

 Isomers are different compounds that have the same molecular formula. Stereoisomers are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in space. Enantiomers are a pair of stereoisomers that are non superimposable mirror images of each other. A 1 1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a racemic mixture. The term . . is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms but which are not mirror images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn Ingold Prelog R S system. When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated or depending on the direction dextro or levorotatory which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers diastereomers and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined in terms of absolute stereochemistry as R or S . The present chemical entities pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers including racemic mixtures optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active R and S isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents or resolved using conventional techniques. The optical activity of a compound can be analyzed via any suitable method including but not limited to chiral chromatography and polarimetry and the degree of predominance of one stereoisomer over the other isomer can be determined. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry and unless specified otherwise it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers.

 Tautomers are structurally distinct isomers that interconvert by tautomerization. Tautomerization is a form of isomerization and includes prototropic or proton shift tautomerization which is considered a subset of acid base chemistry. Prototropic tautomerization or proton shift tautomerization involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order often the interchange of a single bond with an adjacent double bond. Where tautomerization is possible e.g. in solution a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. An example of tautomerization is keto enol tautomerization. A specific example of keto enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane 2 4 dione and 4 hydroxypent 3 en 2 one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol keto tautomerization.

A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention typically contains an active ingredient e.g. a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and or coordination complex thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients carriers including but not limited inert solid diluents and fillers diluents sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents permeation enhancers solubilizers and adjuvants.

Described below are non limiting exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and methods for preparing the same.

In some embodiments the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration.

In some embodiments the invention provides a solid pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing i an effective amount of a compound of the present invention optionally ii an effective amount of a second agent and iii a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments the composition further contains iv an effective amount of a third agent.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition may be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms such as capsules cachets or tablets or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non aqueous liquid an oil in water emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules optionally mixed with an excipient such as but not limited to a binder a lubricant an inert diluent and or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.

This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example water may be added e.g. 5 in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and or humidity during manufacturing packaging and or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly anhydrous compositions may be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include but are not limited to hermetically sealed foils plastic or the like unit dose containers blister packs and strip packs.

An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers such as for example water glycols oils alcohols flavoring agents preservatives coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions solutions and elixirs or aerosols or carriers such as starches sugars micro crystalline cellulose diluents granulating agents lubricants binders and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example suitable carriers include powders capsules and tablets with the solid oral preparations. If desired tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.

Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to corn starch potato starch or other starches gelatin natural and synthetic gums such as acacia sodium alginate alginic acid other alginates powdered tragacanth guar gum cellulose and its derivatives e.g. ethyl cellulose cellulose acetate carboxymethyl cellulose calcium sodium carboxymethyl cellulose polyvinyl pyrrolidone methyl cellulose pre gelatinized starch hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose microcrystalline cellulose and mixtures thereof.

Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include but are not limited to talc calcium carbonate e.g. granules or powder microcrystalline cellulose powdered cellulose dextrates kaolin mannitol silicic acid sorbitol starch pre gelatinized starch and mixtures thereof.

Disintegrants may be used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant may produce tablets which may disintegrate in the bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient s from the dosage form. Thus a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient s may be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used may vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration and may be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant may be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include but are not limited to agar agar alginic acid calcium carbonate microcrystalline cellulose croscarmellose sodium crospovidone polacrilin potassium sodium starch glycolate potato or tapioca starch other starches pre gelatinized starch other starches clays other algins other celluloses gums or mixtures thereof.

Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include but are not limited to calcium stearate magnesium stearate mineral oil light mineral oil glycerin sorbitol mannitol polyethylene glycol other glycols stearic acid sodium lauryl sulfate talc hydrogenated vegetable oil e.g. peanut oil cottonseed oil sunflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil zinc stearate ethyl oleate ethylaureate agar or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include for example a syloid silica gel a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.

When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents coloring matter or dyes and if so desired emulsifying and or suspending agents together with such diluents as water ethanol propylene glycol glycerin and various combinations thereof.

The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent for example calcium carbonate calcium phosphate or kaolin or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium for example peanut oil liquid paraffin or olive oil.

Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include but are not limited to hydrophilic surfactants lipophilic surfactants and mixtures thereof. That is a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants may be employed a mixture of lipophilic surfactants may be employed or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant may be employed.

A suitable hydrophilic surfactant may generally have an HLB value of at least 10 while suitable lipophilic surfactants may generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic lipophilic balance HLB value . Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic and have greater solubility in oils while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10 as well as anionic cationic or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly lipophilic i.e. hydrophobic surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10.

In one embodiment the composition may include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and or dissolution of the compound of the present invention and to minimize precipitation of the compound of the present invention. This can be especially important for compositions for non oral use e.g. compositions for injection. A solubilizer may also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and or other components such as surfactants or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion.

Examples of suitable solubilizers include but are not limited to the following alcohols and polyols such as ethanol isopropanol butanol benzyl alcohol ethylene glycol propylene glycol butanediols and isomers thereof glycerol pentaerythritol sorbitol mannitol transcutol dimethyl isosorbide polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyvinylalcohol hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000 such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether glycofurol or methoxy PEG amides and other nitrogen containing compounds such as 2 pyrrolidone 2 piperidone .epsilon. caprolactam N alkylpyrrolidone N hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone N alkylpiperidone N alkylcaprolactam dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone esters such as ethyl propionate tributylcitrate acetyl triethylcitrate acetyl tributyl citrate triethylcitrate ethyl oleate ethyl caprylate ethyl butyrate triacetin propylene glycol monoacetate propylene glycol diacetate caprolactone and isomers thereof valerolactone and isomers thereof butyrolactone and isomers thereof and other solubilizers known in the art such as dimethyl acetamide dimethyl isosorbide N methyl pyrrolidones monooctanoin diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and water.

Particularly preferred solubilizers include sorbitol glycerol triacetin ethyl alcohol PEG 400 glycofurol and propylene glycol.

The amount of solubilizer that can be included is not particularly limited. The amount of a given solubilizer may be limited to a bioacceptable amount which may be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances it may be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts for example to maximize the concentration of the drug with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the composition to a patient using conventional techniques such as distillation or evaporation. Thus if present the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of 10 25 50 100 or up to about 200 by weight based on the combined weight of the drug and other excipients. If desired very small amounts of solubilizer may also be used such as 5 2 1 or even less. Typically the solubilizer may be present in an amount of about 1 to about 100 more typically about 5 to about 25 by weight.

The composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include without limitation detackifiers anti foaming agents buffering agents polymers antioxidants preservatives chelating agents viscomodulators tonicifiers flavorants colorants odorants opacifiers suspending agents binders fillers plasticizers lubricants and mixtures thereof.

The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin for the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid thimerosal and the like.

Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compound of the present invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients as enumerated above as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions certain desirable methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof.

In some embodiments the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for transdermal delivery containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for transdermal delivery.

Compositions of the present invention can be formulated into preparations in solid semi solid or liquid forms suitable for local or topical administration such as gels water soluble jellies creams lotions suspensions foams powders slurries ointments solutions oils pastes suppositories sprays emulsions saline solutions dimethylsulfoxide DMSO based solutions. In general carriers with higher densities are capable of providing an area with a prolonged exposure to the active ingredients. In contrast a solution formulation may provide more immediate exposure of the active ingredient to the chosen area.

The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients which are compounds that allow increased penetration of or assist in the delivery of therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum permeability barrier of the skin. There are many of these penetration enhancing molecules known to those trained in the art of topical formulation.

Administration of the compounds or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes intraduodenal routes parenteral injection including intravenous intraarterial subcutaneous intramuscular intravascular intraperitoneal or infusion topical e.g. transdermal application rectal administration via local delivery by catheter or stent or through inhalation. Compounds can also be administered intraadiposally or intrathecally.

The amount of the compound administered will be dependent on the mammal being treated the severity of the disorder or condition the rate of administration the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day preferably about 1 to about 35 mg kg day in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g day preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g day. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day.

In some embodiments a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically such administration will be by injection e.g. intravenous injection in order to introduce the agent quickly. However other routes may be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention may also be used for treatment of an acute condition.

In some embodiments a compound of the invention is administered in multiple doses. Dosing may be about once twice three times four times five times six times or more than six times per day. Dosing may be about once a month once every two weeks once a week or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound of the invention and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound of the invention and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6 10 14 28 days two months six months or one year. In some cases continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary.

Administration of the agents of the invention may continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments an agent of the invention is administered for more than 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 14 or 28 days. In some embodiments an agent of the invention is administered for less than 28 14 7 6 5 4 3 2 or 1 day. In some embodiments an agent of the invention is administered chronically on an ongoing basis e.g. for the treatment of chronic effects.

An effective amount of a compound of the invention may be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities including rectal buccal intranasal and transdermal routes by intra arterial injection intravenously intraperitoneally parenterally intramuscularly subcutaneously orally topically or as an inhalant.

The compositions of the invention may also be delivered via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent for example or an artery inserted cylindrical polymer. Such a method of administration may for example aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by theory compounds of the invention may slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound of the invention may be administered for example by local delivery from the struts of a stent from a stent graft from grafts or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix may be a polymeric matrix and may serve to bond the compound to the stent. Polymeric matrices suitable for such use include for example lactone based polyesters or copolyesters such as polylactide polycaprolactonglycolide polyorthoesters polyanhydrides polyaminoacids polysaccharides polyphosphazenes poly ether ester copolymers e.g. PEO PLLA polydimethylsiloxane poly ethylene vinylacetate acrylate based polymers or copolymers e.g. polyhydroxyethyl methylmethacrylate polyvinyl pyrrolidinone fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and cellulose esters. Suitable matrices may be nondegrading or may degrade with time releasing the compound or compounds. Compounds of the invention may be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip spin coating spray coating dip coating and or brush coating. The compounds may be applied in a solvent and the solvent may be allowed to evaporate thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively the compound may be located in the body of the stent or graft for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents may be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent may be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments compounds of the invention may be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker may be used which degrades in vivo leading to the release of the compound of the invention. Any bio labile linkage may be used for such a purpose such as ester amide or anhydride linkages. Compounds of the invention may additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of the compounds via the pericard or via advential application of formulations of the invention may also be performed to decrease restenosis.

Class I PI3 Ks can be either purchased p110 p85 p110 p85 p110 p85 from Upstate and p110 from Sigma or expressed as previously described Knight et al. 2004 . IC50 values are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity described below or a high throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase inhibitor 2 DMSO final concentration buffer 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4 10 mM MgCl2 and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol 100 g ml . Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 Ci of 32P ATP to a final concentration 10 or 100 M and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 l 1N HCl followed by 160 l CHCl MeOH 1 1 . The biphasic mixture is vortexed briefly centrifuged and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3 4 hours in a 65 35 solution of n propanol 1M acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried exposed to a phosphorimager screen Storm Amersham and quantitated. For each compound kinase activity is measured at 10 12 inhibitor concentrations representing two fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested typically 200 M . For compounds showing significant activity IC50 determinations are repeated two to four times and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements.

Other commercial kits or systems for assaying PI3 K activities are available. The commercially available kits or systems can be used to screen for inhibitors and or agonists of PI3 Ks including but not limited to PI 3 Kinase and . An exemplary system is PI 3 Kinase human HTRF Assay from Upstate. The assay can be carried out according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly the assay is a time resolved FRET assay that indirectly measures PIP3 product formed by the activity of a PI3 K. The kinase reaction is performed in a microtitre plate e.g. a 384 well microtitre plate . The total reaction volume is approximately 20 ul per well. In the first step each well receives 2 ul of test compound in 20 dimethylsulphoxide resulting in a 2 DMSO final concentration. Next approximately 14.5 ul of a kinase PIP2 mixture diluted in 1 reaction buffer is added per well for a final concentration of 0.25 0.3 ug ml kinase and 10 uM PIP2. The plate is sealed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. To start the reaction 3.5 ul of ATP diluted in 1 reaction buffer is added per well for a final concentration of 10 uM ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 5 ul of Stop Solution per well and then 5 ul of Detection Mix is added per well. The plate is sealed incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then read on an appropriate plate reader. Data is analyzed and IC50s are generated using GraphPad Prism 5.

The stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. For example stability of one or more subject compounds is established by an in vitro assay. In particular an in vitro microsome stability assay is established that measures stability of one or more subject compounds when reacting with mouse rat or human microsomes from liver.

Each tube contains 0.1 L of 10.0 mg ml NADPH 75 L of 20.0 mg ml mouse rat or human liver microsome 0.4 L of 0.2 M phosphate buffer and 425 L of ddHO. Negative control without NADPH tube contains 75 L of 20.0 mg ml mouse rat or human liver microsome 0.4 L of 0.2 M phosphate buffer and 525 L of ddHO. The reaction is started by adding 1.0 L of 10.0 mM tested compound. The reaction tubes are incubated at 37 C. 100 L sample is collected into new Eppendorf tube containing 300 L cold Methanol at 0 5 10 15 30 and 60 minutes of reaction. Samples are centrifuged at 15 000 rpm to remove protein. Supernatant of centrifuged sample is transferred to new tube. Concentration of stable compound after reaction with microsome in the supernatant is measured by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry LC MS .

The stability of one or more subject compounds in plasma is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. See e.g. 10 1019 1026. The following procedure is an HPLC MS MS assay using human plasma other species including monkey dog rat and mouse are also available. Frozen heparinized human plasma is thawed in a cold water bath and spun for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm at 4 C. prior to use. A subject compound is added from a 400 M stock solution to an aliquot of pre warmed plasma to give a final assay volume of 400 L or 800 L for half life determination containing 5 M test compound and 0.5 DMSO. Reactions are incubated with shaking for 0 minutes and 60 minutes at 37 C. or for 0 15 30 45 and 60 minutes at 37 C for half life determination.

Cells comprising components of the Akt mTOR pathway including but not limited to L6 myoblasts B ALL cells B cells T cells leukemia cells bone marrow cells p190 transduced cells philladelphia chromosome positive cells Ph and mouse embryonic fibroblasts are typically grown in cell growth media such as DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum and or antibiotics and grown to confluency.

In order to compare the effect of one or more compounds disclosed herein on Akt activation said cells are serum starved overnight and incubated with one or more compounds disclosed herein or about 0.1 DMSO for approximately 1 minute to about 1 hour prior to stimulation with insulin e.g. 100 nM for about 1 minutes to about 1 hour. Cells are lysed by scraping into ice cold lysis buffer containing detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and protease inhibitors e.g. PMSF . After contacting cells with lysis buffer the solution is briefly sonicated cleared by centrifugation resolved by SDS PAGE transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF and immunoblotted using antibodies to phospho Akt S473 phospho Akt T308 Akt and actin Cell Signaling Technologies .

It is expected that one or more compounds of the present disclosure inhibit insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at S473. Alternatively some compounds disclosed herein additionally inhibit insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at T308. Such class of compounds can inhibit Akt more effectively than rapamycin and may be indicative of mTORC2 inhibitors or inhibitors of upstream kinases such as PI3K or Akt.

PI3K Akt mTor signaling is measured in blood cells using the phosflow method Methods Enzymol. 2007 434 131 54 . The advantage of this method is that it is by nature a single cell assay so that cellular heterogeneity can be detected rather than population averages. This allows concurrent distinction of signaling states in different populations defined by other markers. Phosflow is also highly quantitative. To test the effects of the inhibitors disclosed herein unfractionated splenocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti CD3 to initiate T cell receptor signaling. The cells are then fixed and stained for surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins. It is expected that inhibitors disclosed herein inhibit anti CD3 mediated phosphorylation of Akt S473 and S6 whereas rapamycin inhibits S6 phosphorylation and enhances Akt phosphorylation under the conditions tested.

Similarly aliquots of whole blood are incubated for 15 minutes with vehicle e.g. 0.1 DMSO or kinase inhibitors at various concentrations before addition of stimuli to crosslink the T cell receptor TCR anti CD3 with secondary antibody or the B cell receptor BCR using anti kappa light chain antibody Fab 2 fragments . After approximately 5 and 15 minutes samples are fixed e.g. with cold 4 paraformaldehyde and used for phosflow. Surface staining is used to distinguish T and B cells using antibodies directed to cell surface markers that are known to the art. The level of phosphrylation of kinase substrates such as Akt and S6 are then measured by incubating the fixed cells with labeled antibodies specific to the phosphorylated isoforms of these proteins. The population of cells are then analyzed by flow cytometery. The results are expected to indicate one or more compounds disclosed herein that inhibit the phosphorylation of kinase substrates such as PI3K substrates Akt substrates mTORC1 substrates mTORC2 substrates mTOR substrates MAPK substrates ERK substrates MAPKK substrates and or MEK substrates.

Murine bone marrow cells freshly transformed with a p190 BCR Abl retrovirus herein referred to as p190 transduced cells are plated in the presence of various drug combinations in M3630 methylcellulose media for about 7 days with recombinant human IL 7 in about 30 serum and the number of colonies formed is counted by visual examination under a microscope. The results show that compared to rapamycin compounds of the present disclosure potentiate the effects of a half maximal concentration of known chemotherapeutic agents such as and without limitation imatinib rapamycin and dasatinib at the concentrations examined.

Alternatively human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained from philladelphia chromosome positive Ph and negative Ph patients upon initial diagnosis or relapse. Live cells are isolated and enriched for CD19 CD34 B cell progenitors. After overnight liquid culture cells are plated in methocult GF H4435 Stem Cell Technologies supplemented with cytokines IL 3 IL 6 IL 7 G CSF GM CSF CF Flt3 ligand and erythropoietin and various concentrations of known chemotherapeutic agents in combination with either compounds of the present disclosure. Colonies are counted by microscopy 12 14 days later.

Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a source in two doses about 4 hr apart with approximately 5 Gy each. About 1 hr after the second radiation dose mice are injected i.v. with about 1 10leukemic cells e.g. Ph human or murine cells or p190 transduced bone marrow cells . These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of about 5 10normal bone marrow cells from 3 5 week old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs are harvested for analysis. Kinase inhibitor treatment begins about 10 days after leukemic cell injection and continues daily until the mice become sick or a maximum of approximately 35 days post transplant. Inhibitors are given by oral lavage.

Peripheral blood cells are collected approximately on day 10 pre treatment and upon euthanization post treatment contacted with labled anti hCD4 antibodies and counted by flow cytometry. It is expected that one or more compounds disclosed herein alone or in combination with known chemotherapeutic agents significantly reduce leukemic blood cell counts as compared to treatment with known chemotherapeutic agents e.g. GLEEVEC imatinib alone under the conditions tested.

Mice lacking the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb that opposes PI3K signaling in B cells develop lupus with high penetrance. Fc RIIb knockout mice R2KO Jackson Labs are considered a valid model of the human disease as some lupus patients show decreased expression or function of Fc RIIb S. Bolland and J. V. Ravtech 200012 277 285 .

The R2KO mice develop lupus like disease with anti nuclear antibodies glomerulonephritis and proteinurea within about 4 6 months of age. For these experiments the rapamycin analogue RAD001 available from LC Laboratories is used as a benchmark compound and administered orally. This compound has been shown to ameliorate lupus symptoms in the B6.Sle1z.Sle3z model T. Wu et al. 117 2186 2196 .

Lupus disease model mice such as R2KO BXSB or MLR lpr are treated at about 2 months old approximately for about two months. Mice are given doses of vehicle RAD001 at about 10 mg kg or compounds disclosed herein at approximately 10 mg kg to about 50 mg kg. Blood and urine samples are obtained at approximately throughout the testing period and tested for antinuclear antibodies in dilutions of serum or protein concentration in urine . Serum is also tested for anti ssDNA and anti dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Animals are euthanized at day 60 and tissues harvested for measuring spleen weight and kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is assessed in kidney sections stained with H E. Other animals are studied for about two months after cessation of treatment using the same endpoints.

It is expected that one or more compounds disclosed herein suppresses or delays the onset of lupus symptoms in lupus disease model mice.

Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a ray source. About 1 hr after the radiation dose mice are injected with about 1 106 leukemic cells from early passage p190 transduced cultures e.g. as described in 2005 August 161 1 51 6 . These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of approximately 5 106 normal bone marrow cells from 3 5 wk old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs harvested for flow cytometry and or magnetic enrichment. Treatment begins on approximately day 10 and continues daily until mice become sick or after a maximum of about 35 days post transplant. Drugs are given by oral gavage p.o. . In a pilot experiment a dose of chemotherapeutic that is not curative but delays leukemia onset by about one week or less is identified controls are vehicle treated or treated with chemotherapeutic agent previously shown to delay but not cure leukemogenesis in this model e.g. imatinib at about 70 mg kg twice daily . For the first phase p190 cells that express eGFP are used and postmortem analysis is limited to enumeration of the percentage of leukemic cells in bone marrow spleen and lymph node LN by flow cytometry. In the second phase p190 cells that express a tailless form of human CD4 are used and the postmortem analysis includes magnetic sorting of hCD4 cells from spleen followed by immunoblot analysis of key signaling endpoints p Akt T308 and S473 pS6 and p4EBP 1. As controls for immunoblot detection sorted cells are incubated in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors of the present disclosure inhibitors before lysis. Optionally phosflow is used to detect p Akt S473 and pS6 S235 236 in hCD4 gated cells without prior sorting. These signaling studies are particularly useful if for example drug treated mice have not developed clinical leukemia at the 35 day time point. Kaplan Meier plots of survival are generated and statistical analysis done according to methods known in the art. Results from p190 cells are analyzed separated as well as cumulatively.

Samples of peripheral blood 100 200 l are obtained weekly from all mice starting on day 10 immediately prior to commencing treatment. Plasma is used for measuring drug concentrations and cells are analyzed for leukemia markers eGFP or hCD4 and signaling biomarkers as described herein.

It is expected that the results of the analysis demonstrate effective therapeutic doses of the compounds disclosed herein for inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells. It is further expected that combination therapy of the inhibitors disclosed herein with other chemotherapeutic agents e.g. dasatinib exhibit a greater degree of efficacy or decreased toxicity in comparison to the use of a single chemotherapeutic agent.
