The present application relates to novel carboxylic acid derivatives having an oxo substituted azaheterocyclic partial structure processes for their preparation their use for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases and their use for producing medicaments for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases especially for the treatment and or prevention of cardiovascular disorders.

One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP . Together with nitric oxide NO which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals it forms the NO cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyze the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate GTP . The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme free preparations cannot by contrast be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide CO is also able to attach to the central iron atom of heme but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.

Through the production of cGMP and the regulation resulting therefrom of phosphodiesterases ion channels and protein kinases guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions the NO cGMP system may be suppressed which may lead for example to high blood pressure platelet activation increased cellular proliferation endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis angina pectoris heart failure thromboses stroke and myocardial infarction.

A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.

Compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of heme. Besides the side effects the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment O. V. Evgenov et al. 5 2006 755 .

Substances which directly stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase i.e. without previous release of NO have been identified in recent years. The indazole derivative YC 1 was the first NO independent but heme dependent sGC stimulator described Evgenov et al. ibid. . Based on YC 1 further substances were discovered which are more potent than YC 1 and show no relevant inhibition of phosphodiesterases PDE . This led to the identification of the pyrazolopyridine derivatives BAY 41 2272 BAY 41 8543 and BAY 63 2521. Together with the recently published structurally different substances CMF 1571 and A 350619 these compounds form the new class of the sGC stimulators Evgenov et al. ibid. . A common characteristic of this substance class is an NO independent and selective activation of the heme containing sGC. In addition the sGC stimulators in combination with NO have a synergistic effect on sGC activation based on a stabilization of the nitrosyl heme complex. The exact binding site of the sGC stimulators at the sGC is still being debated. If the heme group is removed from the soluble guanylate cyclase the enzyme still has a detectable catalytic basal activity i.e. cGMP is still being formed. The remaining catalytic basal activity of the heme free enzyme cannot be stimulated by any of the stimulators mentioned above Evgenov et al. ibid. .

In addition NO and heme independent sGC activators with BAY 58 2667 as prototype of this class have been identified. Common characteristics of these substances are that in combination with NO they only have an additive effect on enzyme activation and that the activation of the oxidized or heme free enzyme is markedly higher than that of the heme containing enzyme Evgenov et al. ibid. J. P. Stasch et al. 136 2002 773 J. P. Stasch et al. 116 2006 2552 . Spectroscopic studies show that BAY 58 2667 displaces the oxidized heme group which as a result of the weakening of the iron histidine bond is attached only weakly to the sGC. It has also been shown that the characteristic sGC heme binding motif Tyr x Ser x Arg is absolutely essential both for the interaction of the negatively charged propionic acids of the heme group and for the action of BAY 58 2667. Against this background it is assumed that the binding site of BAY 58 2667 at the sGC is identical to the binding site of the heme group J. P. Stasch et al. 116 2006 2552 .

The compounds described in the present invention are now likewise capable of activating the heme free form of soluble guanylate cyclase. This is also confirmed by the fact that these novel activators firstly have no synergistic action with NO at the heme containing enzyme and that secondly their action cannot be blocked by the heme dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase 1H 1 2 4 oxadiazolo 4 3 a quinoxalin 1 one ODQ but is even potentiated by this inhibitor cf. O. V. Evgenov et al. 5 2006 755 J. P. Stasch et al. 116 2006 2552 .

The present invention further relates to medicaments which comprise at least one compound according to the invention normally together with one or more inert non toxic pharmaceutically suitable excipients and to the use thereof for the aforementioned purposes.

The compounds according to the invention can act systemically and or locally. For this purpose they can be administered in a suitable way such as for example by the oral parenteral pulmonary nasal sublingual lingual buccal rectal dermal transdermal conjunctival otic routes or as implant or stent.

The compounds according to the invention can be administered in administration forms suitable for these administration routes.

Suitable for oral administration are administration forms which function according to the prior art and deliver the compounds according to the invention rapidly and or in modified fashion and which contain the compounds according to the invention in crystalline and or amorphized and or dissolved form such as for example tablets uncoated or coated tablets for example having enteric coatings or coatings which are insoluble or dissolve with a delay and control the release of the compound according to the invention tablets which disintegrate rapidly in the mouth or films wafers films lyophilisates capsules for example hard or soft gelatin capsules sugar coated tablets granules pellets powders emulsions suspensions aerosols or solutions.

Parenteral administration can take place with avoidance of an absorption step e.g. intravenous intraarterial intracardiac intraspinal or intralumbar or with inclusion of an absorption e.g. intramuscular subcutaneous intracutaneous percutaneous or intraperitoneal . Administration forms suitable for parenteral administration are inter alia preparations for injection and infusion in the form of solutions suspensions emulsions lyophilisates or sterile powders.

Suitable for the other administration routes are for example pharmaceutical forms for inhalation inter alia powder inhalers nebulizers nasal drops solutions or sprays tablets for lingual sublingual or buccal administration films wafers or capsules suppositories preparations for the ears or eyes vaginal capsules aqueous suspensions lotions shaking mixtures lipophilic suspensions ointments creams transdermal therapeutic systems e.g. patches milk pastes foams dusting powders implants or stents.

Oral or parenteral administration is preferred especially oral and intravenous administration. The compounds according to the invention can be converted into the stated administration forms. This can take place in a manner known per se by mixing with inert non toxic pharmaceutically suitable excipients. These excipients include inter alia carriers for example microcrystalline cellulose lactose mannitol solvents e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols emulsifiers and dispersants or wetting agents for example sodium dodecyl sulfate polyoxysorbitan oleate binders for example polyvinylpyrrolidone synthetic and natural polymers for example albumin stabilizers e.g. antioxidants such as for example ascorbic acid colorants e.g. inorganic pigments such as for example iron oxides and masking flavors and or odors.

It has generally proved advantageous to administer on parenteral administration amounts of about 0.001 to 1 mg kg preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg kg of body weight to achieve effective results and on oral administration the dosage is about 0.01 to 100 mg kg preferably about 0.01 to 20 mg kg and very particularly preferably 0.1 to 10 mg kg of body weight.

It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the stated amounts in particular as a function of the body weight route of administration individual response to the active ingredient nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. Thus it may be sufficient in some cases to make do with less than the aforementioned minimum amount whereas in other cases the stated upper limit must be exceeded. It may in the event of administration of larger amounts be advisable to divide these into a plurality of individual doses over the day.

The pharmacological effect of the compounds according to the invention can be shown in the following assays 

Rabbits are anesthetized and sacrificed by intravenous injection of thiopental sodium about 50 mg kg and exsanguinated. The saphenous artery is removed and divided into rings 3 mm wide. The rings are mounted singly on in each case a pair of triangular hooks open at the end and made of 0.3 mm thick special wire Remanium . Each ring is placed under an initial tension in 5 ml organ baths with Krebs Henseleit solution which is at 37 C. is gassed with carbogen and has the following composition NaCl 119 mM KCl 4.8 mM CaCl 2HO 1 mM MgSO 7HO 1.4 mM KHPO1.2 mM NaHCO25 mM glucose 10 mM bovine serum albumin 0.001 . The force of contraction is detected with Statham UC2 cells amplified and digitized via A D converters DAS 1802 HC Keithley Instruments Munich and recorded in parallel on chart recorders. Contractions are induced by addition of phenylephrine.

After several generally 4 control cycles the substance to be investigated is added in each further run in increasing dosage and the level of the contraction achieved under the influence of the test substance is compared with the level of the contraction reached in the last preceding run. The concentration necessary to reduce the contraction reached in the preceding control by 50 is calculated from this IC . The standard application volume is 5 l. The proportion of DMSO in the bath solution corresponds to 0.1 .

Investigations on the stimulation of recombinant soluble guanylate cyclase sGC by the compounds according to the invention with and without sodium nitroprusside and with and without the heme dependent sGC inhibitor 1H 1 2 4 oxadiazolo 4 3a quinoxalin 1 one ODQ are carried out by the method described in detail in the following reference M. Hoenicka E. M. Becker H. Apeler T. Sirichoke H. Schroeder R. Gerzer and J. P. Stasch Purified soluble guanylyl cyclase expressed in a baculovirus Sf9 system Stimulation by YC 1 nitric oxide and carbon oxide 77 1999 14 23. The heme free guanylate cyclase is obtained by adding Tween 20 to the sample buffer 0.5 in the final concentration .

The activation of sGC by a test substance is reported as n fold stimulation of the basal activity. The result for Example 103 is shown in Table 2 

It is evident from Table 2 that stimulation both of the heme containing and of the heme free enzyme is achieved. Furthermore combination of Example 103 and 2 N N diethylamino diazenolate 2 oxide DEA NO an NO donor shows no synergistic effect i.e. the effect of DEA NO is not potentiated as would be expected with an sGC activator acting via a heme dependent mechanism. In addition the effect of the sGC activator according to the invention is not blocked by the heme dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase ODQ but is in fact increased. The results in Table 2 thus confirm the mechanism of action of the compounds according to the invention as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase.

The cellular action of the compounds according to the invention is determined at a recombinant guanylate cyclase reporter cell line as described in F. Wunder et al. 339 104 112 2005 .

Soluble guanylate cyclase sGC converts on stimulation GTP into cGMP and pyrophosphate PPi . PPi is detected with the aid of the assay described below. The signal produced in the assay increases as the reaction progresses and serves as a measure of the sGC enzyme activity under the given stimulation.

To carry out the assay 29 l of enzyme solution 0 10 nM soluble guanylate cyclase prepared according to Honicka et al. 77 14 23 1999 in 50 mM TEA 2 mM MgCl 0.1 BSA fraction V 0.005 Brij pH 7.5 are initially introduced into a microplate and 1 l of the substance to be tested as a serially diluted solution in DMSO is added. The mixture is incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Then 20 l of detection mix 1.2 nM Firefly Luciferase luciferase Promega 29 M dehydroluciferin prepared according to Bitler McElroy 72 358 1957 122 M luciferin Promega 153 M ATP Sigma and 0.4 mM DTT Sigma in 50 mM TEA 2 mM MgCl 0.1 BSA fraction V 0.005 Brij pH 7.5 are added. The enzyme reaction is started by adding 20 l of substrate solution 1.25 mM guanosine 5 triphosphate Sigma in 50 mM TEA 2 mM MgCl 0.1 BSA fraction V 0.005 Brij pH 7.5 and measured continuously in a luminometer. The extent of the stimulation by the substance to be tested can be determined relative to the signal of the unstimulated reaction.

The activation of heme free guanylate cyclase is examined by addition of 25 M of 1H 1 2 4 oxadiazolo 4 3 a quinoxalin 1 one ODQ to the enzyme solution and subsequent incubation for 30 minutes and compared to the stimulation of the native enzyme.

A commercially available telemetry system from Data Sciences International DSI USA is employed for the measurements on conscious SH rats described below.

The system consists of 3 main components 1 implantable transmitters 2 receivers which are linked via a multiplexer to a 3 data acquisition computer. The telemetry system makes it possible to continuously record the blood pressure and heart rate of conscious animals in their usual habitat.

The investigations are carried out on adult female spontaneously hypertensive rats SH rats with a body weight of 200 g. After transmitter implantation the experimental animals are housed singly in type 3 Makrolon cages. They have free access to standard feed and water. The day night rhythm in the experimental laboratory is changed by the room lighting at 6.00 am and at 7.00 m.

The telemetry transmitters TAM PA C40 DSI as employed are surgically implanted under aseptic conditions in the experimental animals at least 14 days before the first experimental use. The animals instrumented in this way can be employed repeatedly after the wound has healed and the implant has settled.

For the implantation the fasted animals are anesthetized with pentobarbital Nembutal Sanofi 50 mg kg i.p. and shaved and disinfected over a large area of their abdomens. After the abdominal cavity has been opened along the linea alba the liquid filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fixed with tissue glue VetBonD 3M . The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally to the abdominal wall muscle and layered closure of the wound is performed. An antibiotic Tardomyocel COMP Bayer 1 ml kg s.c. is administered postoperatively for prophylaxis of infection.

The substances to be investigated are administered orally by gavage in each case to a group of animals n 6 . The test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5 strength Tylose appropriate for an administration volume of 5 ml kg of body weight. A solvent treated group of animals is employed as control.

The telemetry measuring unit is configured for 24 animals. Each experiment is recorded under an experiment number.

Each of the instrumented rats living in the system is assigned a separate receiving antenna 1010 Receiver DSI . The implanted transmitters can be activated externally by means of an incorporated magnetic switch and are switched to transmission in the run up to the experiment. The emitted signals can be detected online by a data acquisition system Dataquest A.R.T. for Windows DSI and be appropriately processed. The data are stored in each case in a file created for this purpose and bearing the experiment number.

In the standard procedure the following are measured for 10 second periods in each case 1 systolic blood pressure SBP 2 diastolic blood pressure DBP 3 mean arterial pressure MAP and 4 heart rate HR .

The acquisition of measured values is repeated under computer control at 5 minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure and stored as individual data. Further technical details are given in the documentation from the manufacturing company DSI .

The test substances are administered at 9.00 am on the day of the experiment. Following the administration the parameters described above are measured over 24 hours. After the end of the experiment the acquired individual data are sorted using the analysis software Dataquest A.R.T. Analysis . The void value is assumed to be the time 2 hours before administration of the substance so that the selected data set includes the period from 7.00 am on the day of the experiment to 9.00 am on the following day.

The data are smoothed over a presettable time by determination of the average 15 minute average 30 minute average and transferred as a text file to a storage medium. The measured values presorted and compressed in this way are transferred into Excel templates and tabulated.
