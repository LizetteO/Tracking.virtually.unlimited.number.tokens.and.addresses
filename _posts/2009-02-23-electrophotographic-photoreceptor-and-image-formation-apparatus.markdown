This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2008 44098 filed on Feb. 26 2008 the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to electrophotographic photoreceptors containing a pyranthrone compound used for image formation of an electrophotographic system and an image formation apparatus by use thereof.

In recent years opportunities to use an electrophotographic copier and a printer have been increased in the field of printing as well as color printing. In the field of printing as well as color printing high quality digital monochromatic or color images tend to be demanded. In order to respond to such the demand it is proposed that a laser light having a short wavelength is employed as a source for exposure to light to form high definition digital images. However the electrophotographic image finally obtained has not sufficiently achieved high image quality even though the laser light having a short wavelength is employed and the dot size of exposure is narrowed to form a minute electrostatic latent image on the electrophotographic photoreceptor.

The reason is that photosensitive properties of the electrophotographic photoreceptor an electrification characteristic of toner in a developer and so forth do not satisfy properties required for formation of minute dot latent images as well as formation of toner images.

That is in cases where the electrophotographic photoreceptor is an organic photoreceptor prepared for a conventional long wavelength laser hereinafter the organic photoreceptor will be also referred to simply as a photoreceptor reproducibility of dot images is sometimes insufficient since a sensitivity characteristic is insufficient and no clear dot latent image is formed when imagewise exposure in which the dot size of exposure is narrowed is conducted with laser light having a short wavelength.

Anthanthrone based pigments and pyranthrone based pigments are conventionally well known as a charge generation material in a photoreceptor utilized for a short wavelength laser Patent Document 1 . However there is no description in Patent Document 1 concerning polycyclic quinone pigments such as the anthanthrone based pigments subjected to a specific treatment and they are simply considered to be commercially available pigments but as for properties such as sensitivity and so forth obtained when these commercially available pigments are employed neither sensitivity nor high speed performance is sufficiently obtained with a high speed printer and copier equipped with a short wavelength laser which is expected to be developed in the near future.

It is known that a particle size of the charge generation material is minimized to form a charge generation layer having high density of the charge generation material in order to improve sensitivity from another aspect. However when this particle minimizing technique is applied to a photoreceptor suitable for a short wavelength laser sensitivity itself is improved but sufficient high speed processing or fogging property is not obtained.

A short wave light emission diode short wave LED emitting light having wave length of 350 500 nm has characteristics liable not to generate moir used as a short wave exposure source in comparison with short wave light emission semiconductor laser. However an organic photoreceptor suitable for the short wave LED and utilizing the advantage of the short wave LED has not been developed.

The present invention was made on the basis of the above described problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide an organic photoreceptor exhibiting high sensitivity suitable for exposure to a light emission diode having an emission wavelength of 350 500 nm as well as high processing speed of 300 mm sec or more with which fog is minimized even under high speed processing. Another object is to provide an image forming apparatus fitted with the organic photoreceptor.

The inventors have found out that when a charge generation material made of particles of a condensed cyclic pigment are arranged to be in the similar forms near an ellipsoid dispersion characteristics of the pigment in an charge generation layer can be improved whereby not only sensitivity is improved but also generation of fog or image defects is minimized even under high speed processing.

The organic photoreceptor has a charge generation layer and a charge transport layer provided on a conductive substrate a ten point surface roughness Rz of the substrate is from 0.2 m or less the charge generation layer contains particles of a condensed polycyclic pigment having an average major axis of 500 nm or less an average aspect ratio of 2.5 to 5.0 and an aspect ratio variation coefficient of 16 or less and quantum efficiency of the photoreceptor is not less than 0.5 the quantum efficiency being defined by a Formula of Q n e wherein Q is reduced amount of charge C in case that light having light amount predetermined so as to make the electric field E becomes times of initial electric field after unit time 1 sec. is exposed to the organic photoreceptor under condition of the initial electric field E 2.5 10 V cm and n cm s is a number of incident photons per unit area 1 cm and in unit time 1 sec. in case that light having light amount predetermined so as to make the electric field E becomes times of initial electric field after unit time 1 sec. is exposed to the organic photoreceptor under condition of the initial electric field E 2.5 10 V cm and e is an amount of charge that an electron has or an elementary electric charge 1.3 10 C .

The organic photoreceptor is suitably employed in an image forming apparatus which includes a charging device to charge the organic photoreceptor a light exposing device which exposes the charged organic photoreceptor to form an electrostatic latent image a developing device to develop the latent image by a toner for forming a toner image and a transfer device which transfers the developed toner image to a transferee and the exposing device comprises an emission diode having an emission peak at wavelength of 350 to 500 nm as the imagewise exposure source.

The photoreceptor having any of the above constitutions are applicable. A under coat layer intermediate layer may be provided on the electroconductive substrate in previous to the formation of the photosensitive layer even when the photoreceptor has any constitution.

The charge transfer layer is a layer having a function to transfer the charge carrier generated in the charge generation layer by light exposure to the surface of the organic photosensitive layer and the charge transfer function can be confirmed by detecting photoconductivity of the sample formed by superposing the charge generation layer and the charge transfer layer on the electroconductive substrate.

The constitution of the organic photoreceptor is described below principally referring the constitution 1 .

Both of sheet shaped and cylinder shaped electroconductive substrates are applicable for the photoreceptor and the cylindrical one is preferable for making compact the image forming apparatus.

The cylindrical electroconductive substrate is a cylindrical substrate necessary for endlessly forming images by rotation thereof and one having a straightness of not more than 0.1 mm and a shaking of not more than 0.1 mm is preferable.

A drum of metal such as aluminum and nickel a plastic drum on which an electroconductive material such as aluminum tin oxide and indium oxide is vapor deposited and a paper plastic drum on which an electroconductive material is coated are usable as the electroconductive material. The relative resistivity of the electroconductive substrate is preferably not more than 10 cm at room temperature. The aluminum substrate is most preferable for the electroconductive substrate of the photoreceptor of the invention.

The electrophotographic photoreceptor relating to the invention may be provided with an intermediate layer between a conductive substrate and a photosensitive layer.

Such an intermediate layer preferably contains N type semiconductor particles. The N type semiconductor particles refer to particles exhibiting the property of the main charge carrier being electrons. In other words since the main charge carrier is electrons the intermediate layer using N type semiconductor particles exhibits properties of efficiently blocking hole injection from the substrate and reduced blocking for electrons from the photosensitive layer.

Preferred N type semiconductor particles include titanium oxide TiO and zinc oxide ZnO of which the titanium oxide is specifically preferred.

N type semiconductor particles employ those having a number average primary particle size of 3 to 200 nm and preferably 5 to 100 nm. The number average primary particle size is a Fere direction average diameter obtained in image analysis when N type semiconductor particles are observed by a transmission electron microscope and 1 000 particles are randomly observed as primary particles from images magnified at a factor of 10 000. In cases when the number average primary particle size of N type semiconductor particles is less than 3 nm it becomes difficult to disperse the N type semiconductor particles in a binder constituting an intermediate layer and the particles are easily aggregated so that the aggregated particles act as a charge trap making it easy to cause a transfer memory.

When the number average primary particle size is more than 200 nm N type semiconductor particles cause unevenness on the intermediate layer surface tendering to cause non uniformity of images via such unevenness. Further when the number average primary particle size is less than 200 nm N type semiconductor particles easily coagulate in the dispersion often causing dot image deterioration.

The ratio of the N type semiconductor particles in the intermediate layer is preferably from 1.0 to 2.0 times of the volume of the binder resin in the intermediate layer. The rectification ability of the intermediate layer is raised by the use of the N type semiconductor particle in the intermediate layer in such the high concentration so that the raising in the residual potential and the degradation of the dot image can be effectively prevented even when the thickness of the intermediate layer is made thick and suitable organic photoreceptor can be prepared. N type semi conductive particles in an amount of 100 to 200 volume parts are preferably used for 100 volume parts of binder resin in the intermediate layer.

Polyamide resin is preferably used for sufficiently dispersing the particles as the binder resin for dispersing the particles to form the intermediate layer and the following polyamide resins are particularly preferred.

An alcohol soluble polyamide resin is preferable for the binder resin of the intermediate layer. As the binder resin of the intermediate layer of the organic photoreceptor a resin having high solubility in solvent is required for forming the intermediate layer having uniform thickness.

It is preferable to incorporate an anti oxidant in the surface layer of the photoreceptor of this invention. The surface layer is liable to be oxidized by an active gas such as NOx and ozone at charging to the photoreceptor whereby an image blur is liable to generate.

In the following there will be described an image forming apparatus in which the electrophotographic photoreceptor can be employed.

When images stored in the storage device reach to a predetermined amount charging device applies a uniform charging operation onto the surface of the photoreceptor . Then image writing device conducts an exposure scanning operation based on the image signals stored in the storage device to form an electrostatic latent image and further developing device develops the electrostatic latent image with toner to form a toner image on the surface of photoreceptor .

Transfer sheet S is fed from paper feeding cassette disposed at a sublevel of the image forming apparatus paper feeding mass cassette disposed at the lower level manual paper feeding cassette disposed at the side surface etc. and is conveyed to a transferring position through resist roller . Transferring device transfers the toner image formed on the surface of photoreceptor to transfer sheet S at the transferring position. Successively fixing unit applies heat and pressure onto transfer sheet S to fix the toner image on it. Then paper ejecting roller ejects transfer sheet S.

When forming images on both sides of the transfer sheet S the conveying path of transfer sheet S branches off the normal ejecting path to inversion conveying path by means of conveying path switching plate after the fixing operation with heat and pressure is applied to one side of the transfer sheet in fixing unit so as to inverse the surface of the transfer sheet S by performing switchback action in the inversion conveying path . Then the transfer sheet S again passes through transferring device to form a toner image on reverse side of the transfer sheet S and then is ejected to outside of the apparatus by means of paper ejecting roller after the fixing operation with heat and or pressure is applied to the reverse side of the transfer sheet S in fixing unit . On the other hand the surface of photoreceptor after the image forming operation is prepared for the next image forming operation by removing residual developer remaining on the surface of the photoreceptor .

A latent image formed on the photoreceptor is developed by supplying a toner with the developing device to form a visible toner image on the surface of the photoreceptor. It is preferred to use a polymer toner for a developer supplied by the developing device in this invention. Specifically a combined use of the polymer toner having uniform shape or particle size distribution and the organic photoreceptor of this invention can achieve high precise image formation of superior sharpness.

The latent image formed on the photoreceptor is visualized via development. The toner used in the development includes pulverized toner and granular polymerization toner. A granular polymerization toner is preferable in view of uniform particle distribution obtained by polymerization process.

Content of fine particles of the toner can be reduced despite of microparticle toner and good image reproduction good sharpness and stable image can be obtained for long period.

A developer used in the development stage may be a single component developer or a two component developer.

Single component developers include a non magnetic single component developer and a magnetic single component developer in which magnetic particles of 0.1 to 0.5 m are contained in toner particles.

A two component developer is prepared by mixing a toner with a carrier. Magnetic particles as a carrier can use conventionally used materials for example metals such as iron ferrite and magnetite and alloys of the foregoing metals and a metal such as aluminum or zinc. Of these ferrite particles are preferred. The foregoing magnetic particles preferably have a volume average particle size of from 15 to 100 m and more preferably from 25 to 80 m.

The numeral designates a rotary drum type photoreceptor which is repeatedly used as an image forming body is rotatably driven anticlockwise as indicated by the arrow at a predetermined circumferential speed.

The photoreceptor is uniformly subjected to an electrostatic charging process at a prescribed polarity and potential by a charging means charging step while being rotated. Subsequently the photoreceptor is subjected to imagewise exposure via an imagewise exposure means imagewise exposure step by using scanning exposure light of a laser beam modulated in correspondence to the time series electric digital image signals of image data to form an electrostatic latent image corresponding to a yellow Y component image color data of the objective color image.

Subsequently the electrostatic latent image is developed by a yellow toner of a first color in a yellow Y developing means Y developing step the yellow developing device . At that time the individual developing devices of the second to fourth developing means M C and Bk magenta developing device cyan developing device black developing device are in operation off and do not act onto the photoreceptor and the yellow toner image of the first color is not affected by the second to fourth developing devices.

The intermediate transfer material is circulately driven clockwise at the same circumferential speed as the photoreceptor while being tightly tensioned onto rollers and

A secondary transfer roller which is allowed to bear parallel to a secondary transfer opposed roller is disposed below the lower surface of the intermediate transfer material while being kept in the state of being separable.

The primary transfer bias for transfer of the first to fourth successive color toner images from the photoreceptor onto the intermediate transfer material is at the reverse polarity of the toner and applied from a bias power source. The applied voltage is for example in the range of 100 V to 2 kV.

In the primary transfer step of the first through third toner images from the photoreceptor to the intermediate transfer material the secondary transfer roller and the cleaning means for the intermediate transfer material are each separable from the intermediate transfer material .

The superimposed color toner image which was transferred onto the intermediate transfer material is transferred to a transfer material P as the second image bearing body in the following manner. Concurrently when the secondary transfer roller is brought into contact with the belt of the intermediate transfer material the transfer material P is fed at a prescribed timing from paired paper feeding resist rollers through a transfer paper guide to the nip in contact with the belt of the intermediate transfer material and the secondary transfer roller . A secondary transfer bias is applied to the second transfer roller from a bias power source. By this secondary transfer bias the superimposed color toner image from the intermediate transfer material is transferred to the transfer material P as a secondary transfer material secondary transfer . The transfer material P having the transferred toner image is introduced to a fixing means and is subjected to thermal fixing.
