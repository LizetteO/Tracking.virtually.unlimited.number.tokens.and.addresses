The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic photosensitive material and a method of forming a black and white image using the same.

In recent movie production even for movies shot on movie films a method in which movie film images master images are digitized to be synthesized and edited and outputted again as analogue images onto a silver halide color photographic photosensitive material using a film recorder is widely used. Many proposals have been made for silver halide color photographic photosensitive materials color intermediate films for use with output by a film recorder including those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 368 230 and 5 283 164 and Vol. 53 pp. 1 7 2008 .

In the movie production although digital archives which store digital data taken unchanged from the master may be an effective archiving method they fail to serve as a final archiving method due to uncertainty surrounding the format and stability of digital data storage media. From the viewpoint of preservation of cultural property in particular the highest reliability is obtained by printing an image corresponding to once digitalized data on a black and white silver halide photosensitive material also called silver halide film subjecting the black and white silver halide photosensitive material to development and fixing treatment so as to form a black silver image and storing the resultant together with the digital data and this procedure is recommended.

The archiving of such digital data on the silver halide film generally employs the film recorder used in the movie production process. Black and white silver halide photographic photosensitive materials are used for the archiving of the digital data by the film recorder.

When the above method is used with a conventional technique image quality is deteriorated when the digital data is outputted onto the silver halide photographic photosensitive material at high resolution which has not always been satisfactory from the viewpoint of obtaining sufficient quality corresponding to the capabilities of digital recorders the performance of which has been remarkably improving. The deterioration of the image quality has been found to be greatly influenced by the development treatment of the black and white silver halide photographic photosensitive material.

The output from the film recorder is controlled to be optimum for the characteristics characteristic curve of the silver halide photographic photosensitive material on which the output is to be printed. When aiming for the reproduction of high resolution digital images it is necessary to suppress variations caused in the development treatment of the silver halide photographic photosensitive material as far as possible and maintain the characteristics as of the time of calibration as far as possible. In particular a large change in gradation on the characteristic curve may cause deterioration of the output image formed by the film recorder.

Now that most movies are in color it has been getting more difficult to maintain the quality of black and white development processing liquid in photofinishing laboratories at which movie films are processed. Further preparing black and white development processing systems of respective kinds is also difficult from the viewpoint of productivity. Silver halide photographic photosensitive materials which are less influenced by processing liquid quality and which show favorable characteristics even when different black and white processing formulations are used have therefore been strongly desired.

The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing problems and aims at providing a silver halide photographic photosensitive material which is capable of recording digital information at high resolution without deterioration and of which variation in characteristics caused by difference in development treatment formulation is small and an image forming method using the same.

According to an aspect of the present invention a silver halide photographic photosensitive material is provided which includes a support and at least one silver halide photosensitive layer on the support wherein the average equivalent sphere diameter of the silver halide of the silver halide photosensitive layer is 0.30 m or less the silver halide photosensitive layer includes four or more kinds of silver halide grains having mutually different average equivalent sphere diameters and the thickness between a surface of the support at a side provided with the silver halide photosensitive layer and a surface of the silver halide photographic photosensitive material is 10 m or less.

According to another aspect of the present invention a silver halide photographic photosensitive material is provided which includes a support and at least one silver halide photosensitive layer on the support wherein D97 which is the contrast on a characteristic curve obtained as a result of three minute development with D97 developer fulfills the condition defined by the following Formula 1 and D96 which is the contrast on a characteristic curve obtained as a result of eight minute development with D96 developer fulfills the condition defined by the following Formula 2 0.6 97 1.6 1 0.6 96 1.6 2 

According to another aspect of the present invention a silver halide photographic photosensitive material is provided in which D97 described above fulfills the condition defined by Formula 1 and D96 described above fulfills the condition defined by Formula 2 and the ratio between D97 and D96 fulfills the following Formula 3 0.8 97 96 1.39 3 

According to another aspect of the present invention a method of forming a black and white image including subjecting the above silver halide photosensitive material to imagewise exposure and development is provided.

In the silver halide photosensitive material of the present invention the silver halide of the silver halide photosensitive layer has an average equivalent sphere diameter of 0.30 m or less and the silver halide photosensitive layer includes four or more kinds of silver halide grains that mutually differ in grain size. On the characteristic curve obtained by developing the silver halide photosensitive material with D97 developer or D96 developer used for black and white development each of D97 and D96 is nearly equal to 1 thus providing a particularly preferable gradation as a silver halide film used for movie archives.

With the silver halide photographic photosensitive material of the present invention variation of the characteristic curve caused by variation of the development processing condition hereinafter referred to as development dependency is small and for example the difference between the above mentioned D97 and D96 is small. Therefore it is not necessary to prepare various types of black and white development processing systems which is preferable from the viewpoint of productivity.

Heretofore EK2238 registered trademark which is a black and white silver halide photosensitive material sold by Eastman Kodak Company has been widely used for movie archives. EK2238 registered trademark contains one kind of silver halide grains having a broad grain size distribution in a silver halide photosensitive layer. Thus either D97 or D96 is far from 1 and the difference between D97 and D96 is large which is not preferable from the viewpoint of productivity.

As described above the silver halide photosensitive material of the invention produces significantly advantageous effects as compared to silver halide photosensitive materials that have been used for conventional movie archives.

Further the silver halide photosensitive material of the invention allows recording of digital data at high resolution using a film recorder and deterioration of image quality is suppressed.

Moreover D97 or D96 is almost equal to 1 and thus a gradation that is particularly preferable for movie archives is obtained. This configuration also reduces development dependency and for example the difference between D97 and D96 can be further decreased.

In the following the silver halide photosensitive material of the present invention is described in detail.

The silver halide photosensitive layer used in the silver halide photographic photosensitive material of the invention usually employs a so called silver halide emulsion in which silver halide grains are dispersed in a hydrophilic binder such as gelatin. In the present invention the average equivalent sphere diameter of the silver halide grains in the silver halide photosensitive layer is 0.30 m or less.

The average equivalent sphere diameter of silver halide grains is an average value of the diameters of the silver halide grains if the silver halide grains are spherical or an average value of the diameters of circle images respectively having the same areas as the projections of the silver halide grains if the silver halide grains are cubic or in other shapes than spheres or an average value of the diameters of the equivalent volume spheres respectively having the same volumes as those of the silver halide grains if the silver halide grains are tabular. The shapes and the projections of the silver halide grains can be observed under a microscope or an electron microscope.

In the present invention the average equivalent sphere diameter of the silver halide grains of the silver halide photosensitive layer is preferably 0.25 m or less more preferably 0.20 m or less and still more preferably 0.19 m or less.

In the present invention the silver halide photosensitive layer includes four or more kinds of silver halide grains having mutually different average equivalent sphere diameters. The four kinds of silver halide grains are each preferably monodispersed. Of the four kinds of monodispersed silver halide grains it is preferred that the average equivalent sphere diameter D1 of the monodispersed silver halide grains having the smallest average equivalent sphere diameter is selected from the range 0.05 m D1 0.10 m and that the average equivalent sphere diameter D2 of the monodispersed silver halide grains having the greatest average equivalent sphere diameter is selected from the range 0.15 m D2 0.30 m.

It is more preferred that D1 is selected from the range 0.05 m D1 0.10 m and that D2 is selected from the range 0.15 m D2 0.25 m. It is most preferred that D1 is selected from the range 0.06 m D1 0.8 m and that D2 is selected from the range 0.17 m D2 0.20 m.

Regarding the average equivalent sphere diameters D3 and D4 of the two monodispersed silver halide grains having average equivalent sphere diameters between D1 and D2 D3 is selected from the range 0.07 m D3 0.12 m and D4 is selected from the range 0.09 m D4 0.17 m. It is more preferred that D3 is selected from the range 0.07 m D3 0.11 m and that D4 is selected from the range 0.09 m D4 0.15 m. It is most preferred that D3 is selected from the range 0.8 m D3 0.10 m and that D4 is selected from the range 0.10 m D4 0.14 m. In any case the combination of D1 to D4 should be selected to satisfy D1

In the present invention the silver halide or silver halides of the four types of monodispersed silver halide grains having different average equivalent sphere diameters for use in the silver halide photosensitive layer are each preferably a silver iodobromide containing silver iodide at 2.5 mol or less a silver iodochloride containing silver iodide at 2.5 mol or less or a silver iodobromochloride containing silver iodide at 2.5 mol or less. When the silver halide containing silver iodide within the above range is used both of the contrast D97 and the contrast D96 are values at or close to 1 as a result of which a gradation particularly preferable for movie archives is obtained. Further this configuration reduces development dependency and for example can further reduces the difference between D97 and D96 . The content of silver iodide is more preferably 2.4 mol or less still more preferably 2.2 mol or less and most preferably 2.0 mol or less.

In the present invention the silver halide photosensitive layer is preferably provided on a support such that the amount of silver of the silver halide grains is in the range of from 1.0 g mto 3.5 g m. When the silver halide photosensitive material has two or more silver halide photosensitive layers the above range of the silver amount means the range of the total silver amount of the silver halide grains contained in all silver halide photosensitive layers.

A more preferred range of the silver amount of the silver halide grains is from 1.0 g mto 2.0 g m and the most preferred range thereof is from 1.5 g mto 2.0 g m.

The monodispersed silver halide grains used in the present invention may have a regular crystal such as cube octahedron or tetradecahedron or an irregular crystal shape such as a spherical or tabular shape or a crystal having a crystal defect such as a twin plane or a composite thereof. Those having cubic crystal shapes are preferred in the present invention.

The silver halide emulsion to be used in the present invention can be prepared using methods described in for example hereinafter abbreviated as RD No. 17643 December 1978 pp. 22 to 23 I. Emulsion preparation and types ibid. No. 18716 November 1979 p. 648 ibid. No. 307105 November 1989 pp. 863 to 865 P. Glafkides Paul Montel 1967 G. F. Duffin Focal Press 1966 and V. L. Zelikman et al. Focal Press 164.

Specifically the silver halide emulsion containing monodispersed silver halide grains for use in the present invention can be prepared by already known methods such as a method of allowing a silver halide solvent to be present when preparing silver halide grains by reacting an aqueous solution of a water soluble halide such as alkali metal halide and an aqueous solution of a water soluble silver salt such as silver nitrate in an aqueous solution of a hydrophilic binder while regulating at least one of preferably both of the pAg and pH of the reaction liquid to be within a certain numerical range as necessary.

Examples of the silver halide solvent include a organic thioethers described in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 271 157 3 531 289 and 3 574 628 and Japanese Patent Application Laid Open JP A Nos. 54 1019 and 54 158917 b thiourea derivatives described in for example JP A Nos. 53 82408 and 55 77737 c silver halide solvents having a thiocarbonyl group sandwiched between an oxygen or sulfur atom and a nitrogen atom described in for example JP A No. 53 144319 d imidazoles described in for example JP A No. 54 100717 e ammonia and f thiocyanate.

The amount of the solvent to be used varies depending on the type thereof. When the solvent is thiocyanate a preferred amount thereof is from 1 10mol to 1 10mol per 1 mol of silver halide.

Depending on the purpose it may be preferable to allow a salt of a metal ion to be present when preparing the emulsion of the present invention for example at the time of grain formation in the desalting step at the time of chemical sensitization and or before coating.

The addition is preferably performed at the time of grain formation when the salt of a metal ion is doped to the grains and the addition is preferably performed after grain formation but before the completion of chemical sensitization when the salt of a metal ion is used to modify the grain surface or is used as a chemical sensitizer.

As described above a method may be selected in which doping to the entire grain doping to a core portion of the grain only doping to a shell portion of the grain only or doping to an epitaxial portion of the grain only is performed.

For example Mg Ca Sr Ba Al Sc Y La Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn Ga Ru Rh Pd Re Os Ir Pt Au Cd Hg Tl In Sn Pb and or Bi may be used.

These metals can be added in any salt form that can be dissolved when forming grains such as in the form of ammonium salts acetates nitrates sulfates phosphates hydroxides six coordinate complex salts or four coordinate complex salts. Examples thereof include CdBr CdCl Cd NO Pb NO Pb CHCOO K Fe CN NH Fe CN KIrCl NH RhCl and KRu CN .

The ligand of the coordination compound may be selected from halo aquo cyano cyanate thiocyanate nitrosyl thionitrisyl oxo or carbonyl. The metal compound may be used singly or in combination of two kinds thereof or in combination of three or more kinds thereof.

The metal compound is preferably added after the compound is dissolved in an appropriate solvent such as water methanol or acetone. In order to stabilize the solution a method of adding an aqueous hydrogen halide solution such as HCl HBr or an alkali halide such as KCl NaCl KBr NaBr may be employed. Acid or alkali may be added as necessary.

The metal compound may be added into a reaction vessel before grain formation or some time during grain formation. The metal compound may be added to the water soluble silver salt such as AgNO or to the aqueous alkali halide solution such as NaCl KBr KI in which case the metal compound can be added continuously during the formation of silver halide grains. It is also possible to prepare another solution separately from the water soluble silver salt and the alkali halide and add this solution continuously in an appropriate period during the grain formation. Combination of various addition methods is also preferable.

A method of adding a chalcogen compound in the course of emulsion preparation such as the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 3 772 031 is effective in some cases.

Other than S Se and Te cyanate thiocyanate selenocyanate carbonate phosphate and or acetate may be present.

Monodispersed silver halide emulsions described in the specifications of U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 574 628 and 3 655 394 and UK Patent No. 1 413 748 are also preferable.

The crystal structure may be uniform or may have inner and outer portions that have mutually different halogen compositions or may have a layered structure.

Silver halides having mutually different compositions may be conjugated by epitaxial junction. A compound other than silver halide such as silver rhodanate or lead oxide may also be conjugated.

The silver halide emulsion may be of surface latent image type which forms a latent image mainly on the surface or of internal latent image type which forms a latent image in the interior of the grain or of a type having a latent image at both the surface and the interior. The silver halide emulsion has to be a negative working silver halide emulsion.

The internal latent image type silver halide emulsion may be a core shell internal latent image type emulsion as described in JP A No. 63 264740 and a preparation method thereof is described in JP A No. 59 133542. The thickness of the shell in the emulsion varies depending on the development processing and the like and is preferably from 3 nm to 40 nm particularly preferably from 5 nm to 20 nm.

The silver halide emulsion to be used in the present invention has preferably been reduction sensitized. For the reduction sensitization any of the following methods may be used a method of adding a reduction sensitizer to silver halide a method of growing or ripening silver halide grains in a low pAg environment having a pAg of from 1 to 7 which is called silver ripening and a method of growing or ripening silver halide grains in a high pH environment having a pH of 8 to 11 which is called high pH ripening. It is also possible to use two or more of these methods in combination.

In particular the method of adding a reduction sensitizer is preferable in that it allows fine regulation of the reduction sensitization level.

Examples of the reduction sensitizer include stannous salts ascorbic acid and derivatives thereof hydroquinone and derivatives thereof catechol and derivatives thereof hydroxylamine and derivatives thereof amines and polyamines hydrazine and derivatives thereof paraphenylenediamine and derivatives thereof formamidine sulfinic acid thiourea dioxide silane compounds and borane compounds.

For the reduction sensitization in the invention a reduction sensitizer such as those described above may be selected and used and two or more compounds may be used in combination.

Regarding the method for the reduction sensitization the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 518 698 3 201 254 3 411 917 3 779 777 and 3 930 867 may be employed. Regarding the usage method of the reducing agent the methods described in Japanese Patent Publication JP B Nos. 57 33572 and 58 1410 and JP A No. 57 179835 may be employed.

The silver halide grains of the present invention may be subjected to at least one selected from sulfur sensitization selenium sensitization tellurium sensitization gold sensitization palladium sensitization noble metal sensitization or reduction sensitization in any step in the production process of the silver halide emulsion. Combination of two or more types of sensitization methods is preferred.

One of chemical sensitizations that can be preferably performed in the present invention is either chalcogen sensitization or noble metal sensitization or a combination of chalcogen sensitization and noble metal sensitization which may be performed using activated gelatin as described in T. H. James 4th ed Macmillan 1977 pp. 67 76 or may be performed at a pAg of 5 to 10 a pH of 5 to 8 and a temperature of 30 to 80 C. using sulfur selenium tellurium gold platinum palladium or iridium or a combination of two or more of these sensitizers as described in vol. 120 April 1974 12008vol. 34 June 1975 13452 U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 642 361 3 297 446 3 772 031 3 857 711 3 901 714 4 266 018 and 3 904 415 and UK patent No. 1 315 755.

In noble metal sensitization a salt of a noble metal such as gold platinum palladium or iridium may be used among which gold sensitization palladium sensitization and a combination of gold sensitization and palladium sensitization is particularly preferred.

In the sulfur sensitization an unstable sulfur compound may be used for which the unstable sulfur compounds as described in for example P. Grafkides 5th ed. Paul Momtel co. 1987 and vol. 307 issue 307105 may be used.

In the selenium sensitization an unstable selenium compound may be used for which the selenium compounds as described in for example JP B Nos. 43 13489 and 44 15748 and JP A Nos. 4 25832 4 109340 4 271341 5 40324 5 11385 6 51415 6 175258 6 180478 6 208186 6 208184 6 317867 7 92599 7 98483 and 7 140579 may be used.

In the tellurium sensitization an unstable tellurium compound may be used for which the unstable tellurium compounds as described in for example JP A Nos. 4 224595 4 271341 4 333043 5 303157 6 27573 6 175258 6 180478 6 208186 6 208184 6 317867 and 7 140579 may be used.

Useful chemical sensitization aids include compounds that are known to suppress fogging in the course of chemical sensitization and increase sensitivity such as azaindene azapyridazine and azapyrimidine. Examples of chemical sensitization aid modifiers are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 131 038 3 411 914 and 3 554 757 JP A No. 58 126526 and pp. 138 to 143 of the above mentioned Duffin 

The chemical sensitization condition in the present invention is not particularly limited and the pAg may be from 6 to 11 preferably from 7 to 10 the pH may be from 4 to 10 preferably from 5 to 8 temperature may be from 40 C. to 95 C. preferably from 45 C. to 85 C.

It is preferable to use an oxidizing agent for silver during the production process of the emulsion of the present invention. The oxidizing agent for silver refers to a compound that has a function of acting on metallic silver and converting it to silver ion. In particular a compound that converts extremely minute silver grains which are generated as a byproduct in the silver halide grain formation process and the chemical sensitization process to silver ion is effective. The silver ion thus generated may form a silver salt that is scarcely soluble in water such as silver halide silver sulfide or silver selenide or a silver salt that easily dissolves in water such as silver nitrate.

Preferred oxidizing agents in the present invention are inorganic oxidizing agents including ozone hydrogen peroxide and addition products thereof halogen elements and thiosulfonates and organic oxidizing agents including quinones.

In a preferred embodiment the reduction sensitization and the oxidizing agent for silver are employed in combination.

The method to be used may be selected from a method of performing reduction sensitization after the oxidizing agent is used an inverted method thereof or a method in which use of the oxidizing agent and reduction sensitization are simultaneously.

These methods may be employed in the grain formation process and or the chemical sensitization process.

Various compounds may be included in the silver halide emulsion used in the present invention for the purpose of suppressing fogging during the production process of the photosensitive material storage of the photosensitive material or photographic processing of the photosensitive material or for the purpose of stabilizing the photographic characteristics.

Many compounds that are known as antifoggants or stabilizers may be used and examples thereof include thiazoles such as benzothiazolium salts nitroimidazoles nitrobenzimidazoles chlorobenzimidazoles bromobenzimidazoles mercaptothiazoles mercaptobenzothiazoles mercaptobenzimidazoles mercaptothiadiazoles aminotriazoles benzotriazoles nitrobenzotriazoles mercaptotetrazoles particularly 1 phenyl 5 mercaptotetrazole mercaptopyrimidines mercaptotriazines thioketocompounds such as oxazolinethione azaindenes such as triazaindenes tetraazaindenes particularly 4 hydroxy substituted 1 3 3a 7 tetraazaindenes and pentaazaindenes. For example those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 954 474 and 3 982 947 and JP B No. 52 28660 may be used.

The antifoggants and the stabilizers may be added at various times depending on the purpose such as before grain formation during grain formation after grain formation in the water washing step at the time of dispersing after the water washing before chemical sensitization during chemical sensitization after chemical sensitization or before coating.

Besides exerting their original antifogging and stabilizing effects when added during the emulsion preparation the antifoggants and the stabilizers may be used for multiple purposes such as controlling the crystal walls of the grains reducing the grain size reducing the solubility of the grains regulating the chemical sensitization and adjusting the dye arrangement.

In terms of exerting the effects of the present invention it is preferable that the silver halide emulsion used in the present invention is spectrally sensitized with a methine dye or the like. Examples of the dye to be used include cyanine dyes merocyanine dyes complex cyanine dyes complex merocyanine dyes holopolar cyanine dyes hemicyanine dyes styryl dyes and hemioxonol dyes.

Particularly useful dyes include dyes belonging to cyanine dyes merocyanine dyes and complex merocyanine dyes. Any of basic heterocyclic nuclei that are usually used in cyanine dyes can be applied as the basic heterocyclic nuclei of these dyes. Examples of applicable nuclei include a pyrroline nucleus an oxazoline nucleus a thiazoline nucleus a pyrrole nucleus an oxazole nucleus a thiazole nucleus a selenazole nucleus an imidazole nucleus a tetrazole nucleus a pyridine nucleus a nucleus obtained by fusion of an alicyclic hydrocarbon ring to any of the above nuclei and a nuclei obtained by fusion of an aromatic hydrocarbon ring to any of the above nuclei examples of which include an indolenine nucleus a benzoindolenine nucleus an indole nucleus a benzoxazole nucleus a naphthoxazole nucleus a benzothiazole nucleus a naphthothiazole nucleus a benzoselenazole nucleus a benzimidazole nucleus and a quinoline nucleus. These nuclei may have a substituent on a carbon atom thereof.

A five membered to six membered heterocyclic nucleus such as a pyrazolin 5 one nucleus a thiohydantoin nucleus a 2 thiooxazolidine 2 4 dione nucleus a thiazolidine 2 4 dione nucleus a rhodanine nucleus or a thiobarbituric acid nucleus may be applied as a nuclei having a ketomethylene structure of the merocyanine dye or complex merocyanine dye.

The sensitizing dye may be used singly or in combination thereof. The combination of sensitizing dyes is often used for the purpose of supersensitization. Representative examples thereof are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 688 545 2 977 229 3 397 060 3 522 052 3 527 641 3 617 293 3 628 964 3 666 480 3 672 898 3 679 428 3 703 377 3 769 301 3 814 609 3 837 862 and 4 026 707 UK Patent Nos. 1 344 281 and 1 507 803 JP B Nos. 43 4936 and 53 12375 and JP A Nos. 52 110618 and 52 109925.

The emulsion may include together with the sensitizing dye a substance that shows supersensitization wherein the substance is a dye not having spectral sensitizing effect per se or a substance substantially not absorbing visible light.

The time when the sensitizing dye is added into the emulsion may be any stage of the emulsion preparation at which the addition is known to be effective. Most commonly the addition is performed during a period after the completion of the chemical sensitization but before coating. However the addition may be conducted at the same period as the addition of the chemical sensitizer so as to perform the spectral sensitization and the chemical sensitization simultaneously as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 628 969 and 4 225 666 or may be conducted before the chemical sensitization as described in JP A No. 58 113928 or may be conducted before completion of generation of silver halide grain precipitate so as to initiate the spectral sensitization.

Further the compounds described above may be added in portions as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 225 666 in other words it is possible to add a part of these compounds prior to the chemical sensitization and add the remaining part after the chemical sensitization wherein the addition may be performed at any time during the formation of silver halide grains and a typical method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 183 756.

The silver halide photographic photosensitive material of the present invention has at least one silver halide photosensitive layer on a support. The silver halide photographic photosensitive material of the present invention may have two or more silver halide photosensitive layers in which case the at least four kinds of monodispersed silver halide grains of the present invention having mutually different average equivalent sphere diameters may respectively be included in any layer or layers as long as the objects of the present invention are achieved.

When two or more silver halide photosensitive layers are provided the plural silver halide emulsion layers are preferably arranged in a manner in which two layers which are a high sensitivity emulsion layer and a low sensitivity emulsion layer are arranged on a support such that the sensitivity is sequentially decreased toward the support as described in the specifications of German Patent No. 1 121 470 and UK Patent No. 923 045. The arrangement may alternatively be such that a low sensitivity emulsion layer is disposed at a side farther from the support and a high sensitivity emulsion layer is disposed at a side nearer to the support as described in JP A Nos. 57 112751 62 200350 62 206541 and 62 206543.

In the photosensitive material of the present invention two or more kinds of emulsion that mutually differ in at least one characteristic selected from the grain size grain size distribution halogen composition grain shape or sensitivity of the silver halide photosensitive emulsion may be mixed and used in the same layer.

A non photosensitive layer may be provided as at least one of the following a protective layer provided on the silver halide photosensitive layer a layer disposed between the support and the silver halide photosensitive layer or when there are two or more silver halide photosensitive layers an intermediate layer disposed between the silver halide photosensitive layers. These layers may include various additives.

For example a non photosensitive layer provided between the support and the silver halide photosensitive layer may include a dye or pigment and this layer may serve as an antihalation layer.

The protective layer may include a matte agent for providing minute irregularities on its surface. Inclusion of the matte agent in the protective layer is advantageous in preventing mutual adhesion of photographic photosensitive materials when the photographic photosensitive materials are superposed on one another and stored. The matte agent may be soluble in the processing liquid or insoluble in the processing liquid. It is preferable to use both of a processing liquid soluble matte agent and a processing liquid insoluble matte agent in combination. For example polymethyl methacrylate poly methyl methacrylate methacrylic acid 9 1 molar ratio or 5 5 molar ratio polystyrene particles and the like are preferable.

Samples were exposed to light using a laser exposure apparatus ARRILASER manufactured by ARRI. Two development treatments were conducted using D96 and D97 respectively which are described in Processing KODAK Motion Picture Films Module 15 Processing Black and White Films. The development time for D96 was 8 minutes while the development time for D97 was 3 minutes. For evaluation of contrast samples were exposed to a 21 level gray patch of ARRIaqua image using an ARRILASERG laser and then subjected to a development treatment and then measured for density values of the 21 level gray patch by V visual to obtain a characteristic curve. The gradient at the density that is the minimum density 1.0 was determined from the characteristic curve. The V density value were measured by a X rite.

Further calibration was performed using the measured density values and using Calros.aim as the target curve and exposure to the ARRIaqua image and development thereof were conducted.

Films for screening black and white positive film manufactured by Fujifilm Corporation were produced from the obtained films by printing and flare evaluation was performed by screening. The evaluation was performed by scoring on a scale of 1 to 5 on which 1 indicates a case in which flare was not observed at all and 3 or less was tolerable level. Using this scale functional evaluation by 20 people was performed and an average score thereof was determined.

After the calibration separate development treatments treatments with D96 on the ARRI aqua image were conducted for a development time of 8 which is the standard development time and 7 30 respectively. The change in density when the 7 30 treatment was performed after exposing at a light quantity which offers Dmin 2.0 on the characteristic curve obtained by density measurement of the 21 level gray patch by the 8 treatment was measured to determine process dependency.

As is understood from the results shown in Tables 2 1 and 2 2 silver halide photographic photosensitive material sample 101 according to the present invention exhibited a D97 of 1.3 a D96 of 1.1 and a D97 D96 of 1.18 which indicates suitable characteristics for digital archives. Similar conclusions may apply to samples 105 107 108 and 110 according to the present invention. In contrast sample 102 exhibited d97 f 3.0 and D96 of 2.5 and calibration was impossible. In the case of sample 103 D97 was 1.3 D96 was 0.9 however D97 D96 was 1.44 indicating excessively high processing liquid dependency and deterioration in flare. Therefore sample 103 is unsuitable for digital archives. In the case of sample 104 D97 was 1.7 and D96 was 1.4 and the excessively high y values and deterioration in flare make it unsuitable for digital archives. In the case of sample 106 D97 D96 was 1.4 which indicates high processing liquid dependency and deterioration in flare.
