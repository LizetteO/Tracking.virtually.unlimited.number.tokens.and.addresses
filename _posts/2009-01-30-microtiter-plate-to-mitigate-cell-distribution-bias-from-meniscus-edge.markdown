The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to meniscus removal or mitigation in cavity wells of a microtiter plate for improved homogeneity of biological cell distribution. In particular the invention provides devices to suppress or redistribute surface tension effects of the liquid contained in the wells.

Multiwell or microtiter plates are ubiquitous in biological and pharmaceutical research. A microtiter plate also known as microplate represents a flat plate with multiple uniform wells used as small test tubes. The microplate has become a standard tool in analytical research and clinical diagnostic testing laboratories.

Conventional wells in a microtiter plate yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide a lid assembly for superposition above the microtiter plate to mitigate or remove the meniscus along the periphery of sample liquid in the cavity wells of a microtiter plate. The assembly includes a lid plate having a mount surface an array of plugs corresponding to the array of wells and a plurality of posts.

In various exemplary embodiments each plug extends below from the mount surface and is insertable into the periphery of a counterpart well for contact with the liquid. The plurality of posts suspends the lid plate above the microtiter plate. In various exemplary embodiments each post optionally passes through an orifice through the mount surface with each post including an adjustable clamp to support the lid plate. In alternate exemplary embodiments the mount surface optionally includes an array of cavities that correspond in disposition to the array of plugs. Each plug is independently insertable through the mount surface to adjust depth of each plug into its counterpart well.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Such devises allow researchers to perform optical and spectroscopic analysis on biological samples by submersing them within various fluidic environments. Accordingly maximal control of the sedimentation process is desirable so as to provide as much uniformity as possible both within individual wells and throughout the entire plate.

Due to surface tension of the liquid the interface exhibits curvature between the lateral periphery and the center of the well for typical sample sizes. The curvature can be concave or convex depending on the contact angle between the liquid and the peripheral boundary. This phenomenon is most pronounced by the meniscus rise along the edges adjacent the boundary of the well thereby producing a concave curvature.

Non uniform sedimentation of cells yields a survival consequence such that those that settle within the meniscus edge region with many neighbors survive as indicated by lighter shade whereas those in the other regions and toward the center with few neighbors perish as denoted by darker shade .

This technique can be labeled as a beveled well meniscus reduction microplate to reduce the degree of meniscus curvature by confining the outer periphery that adjoins a boundary to an annular bevel portion. The liquid surface spans across a wider extent within the bevel thereby flattening the surface within the section . The reduced curvature of the liquid surface homogenizes cell distribution within the well .

This technique can be labeled as a meniscus suppression lid applicable for either fixed or variable liquid volume. The lid employs a plug that protrudes into the well . The plug s terminating surface contacts the surface of the liquid contained in the well thereby removing the meniscus curvature. Special coatings can be employed on the surface to inhibit material of the liquid from adhering to the plug . Typical microtiter plates having arrays of 6 12 24 48 96 and 384 wells can remain unmodified for this embodiment. Instead a researcher merely obtains lid inserts to use with commercially available microplates.

These plugs correspond to and are disposed above the wells to suppress meniscus formation in their liquid contents . A set of displacement posts provide support adjacent the outer corners of the lid plate . Each post includes a translatable clamp to adjust the position of the lid plate from the microplate or its support platform.. The combination of lid plate plugs posts and clamp represent a lid assembly to retrofit with a conventional plate .

Each plug insertably fits into its corresponding well . For circular geometries the plug s outer diameter is therefore less than the well s inner diameter. Preferably the plug s outer diameter is only slightly smaller than the well s inner diameter to minimize meniscus effects.

The clamps support the lid plate along their corresponding posts to be disposed above the microplate . The clamps can be adjusted to enable the plugs to be disposed within their corresponding wells thereby suppressing meniscus formation within their liquid contents .

Each plug can be vertically adjusted relative to the surface of the lid plate . A series of support columns extend below the lid plate . The combination of lid plate plugs and columns represent a lid assembly to retrofit with a conventional plate . The columns engage the microplate in gaps between adjacent wells to suspend the lid plate above the microplate . The disposition of plug extending from the lid plate is tailored to descend into its corresponding well to that specific depth so as to suppress the meniscus in that liquid content .

Near the wall proximate cells cluster together in greater density than distal cells towards the center. By contrast demonstrates cell distribution effect from meniscus mitigation in a photograph also showing the wall . Distribution of cells exhibits considerable uniformity along the vector .

By suppressing meniscus formation in well liquid cell distribution uniformity can be augmented. This can be accomplished by engaging a lid plug against the liquid at its top surface. Alternatively this can also be accomplished by providing radially segregated chambers at the liquid surface. These chambers can be bounded by an upper cylinder for the cells under evaluation and a bevel cone for diverting the meniscus by its extension.

The efforts leading to the described embodiments are directed to providing tissue culture plates that mitigate differential stacking of cells towards the well s periphery. The photograph illustrates effects of cell stacking. In addition to there being more cells on the perimeter of the well the cells towards the middle are dead as indicated by the stain from the darkening blue dye.

These untreated cells were seeded in the well washed and deposited in the incubator for an interval. This heterogeneous pattern also extends to treated cells. Various exemplary embodiments present techniques to distribute the cells homogeneously on the bottom of the well in the plate . The principle options include modifying the well to expand the meniscus and incorporating a lid to conform the meniscus to a flat solid surface.

For a multiwell microplate in which each well contains equal volumes the configuration of the lid assembly shown in views and is appropriate. This application in which overall plate volume changes are required for different experiments employs the lid for constant volume meniscus removal with fixed plugs . Each plug has the same dimension and extension from the lid surface being permanently attached thereto.

Adjustability for different overall meniscus heights for different experiments can be achieved by sliding the entire lid upon the posts that protrude through orifices in the lid and include adjustably translatable clamps capable of supporting the lid s weight at a desired height. To avoid splay the posts can optionally interface with the bracketing tray which can be designed for adaptability to enclose standard microplates of various sizes or else be rigid for a fixed configuration.

For a multiwell plate in which each well contains a different volume the configuration of the lid assembly shown in view can be implemented. In this application the lid plate has an array of cavities and each plug individually slides through its corresponding cavity such as by pushing with a finger. The lid plate has support columns that remain fixed in position to provide a constant separation from the microplate enabling for maximum penetration of any particular plug to the bottom of any given well .

The dimensions of the extruding plugs and need not fill the entire corresponding well and . Although such variation might affect the meniscus response plugs narrower than the inner region of the well may exhibit advantages in production cost and reduced surface interaction. Additionally a single plug may be replaced with multiple smaller plugs whose adjustability can be individually customized for either the lid plate or within a sub plug platform inserted in lieu of the plug .

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
