This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 522 911 filed Jul. 7 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 659 241 which was filed under 35 U.S.C. 371 as a national stage application of International Application No. PCT US2003 24209 filed Jul. 31 2003 which further claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 400 403 filed Jul. 31 2002. The disclosures of each of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention is directed to Drug Linker Ligand Conjugates and to Drug Linker Compounds to compositions comprising a Drug Linker Ligand Conjugate or a Drug Linker Compound and to methods for using the same to treat cancer an autoimmune disease or an infectious disease.

Several short peptidic compounds have been isolated from natural sources and found to have biological activity. Analogs of these compounds have also been prepared and some were found to have biological activity. For example Auristatin E U.S. Pat. No. 5 635 483 to Pettit et al. is a synthetic analogue of the marine natural product Dolastatin 10 an agent that inhibits tubulin polymerization by binding to the same site on tubulin as the anticancer drug vincristine G. R. Pettit 70 1 79 1997 . Dolastatin 10 auristatin PE and auristatin E are linear peptides having four amino acids three of which are unique to the dolastatin class of compounds. Both dolastatin 10 and auristatin PE are presently being used in human clinical trials to treat cancer. The structural differences between dolastatin 10 and auristatin E reside in the C terminal residue in which the thiazolephenethyl amine group of dolastatin 10 is replaced by a norephedrine unit in auristatin E.

The following references disclose dolastatin and auristatin compounds and analogs thereof and their use for treating cancer 

Despite in vitro data for compounds of the dolastatin class and its analogs significant general toxicities at doses required for achieving a therapeutic effect compromise their efficacy in clinical studies. Accordingly there is a clear need in the art for dolastatin derivatives having significantly lower toxicity yet useful therapeutic efficiency compared to current dolastatin drug therapies.

The recitation of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not an admission that the reference is prior art to this application.

The compounds of formulas IIa i are useful for treating or preventing cancer an autoimmune disease or an infectious disease in an animal.

The Linker unit of the Drug Linker Ligand Conjugate links the Drug unit and the Ligand unit and has the formula A W Y wherein 

The Stretcher unit A when present links a Ligand unit to an amino acid unit W . In this regard a Ligand L has a functional group that can form a bond with a functional group of a Stretcher. Useful functional groups that can be present on a ligand either naturally or via chemical manipulation include but are not limited to sulfhydryl SH amino hydroxyl carboxy the anomeric hydroxyl group of a carbohydrate and carboxyl. Preferred Ligand functional groups are sulfhydryl and amino. Sulfhydryl groups can be generated by reduction of an intramolecular disulfide bond of a Ligand. Alternatively sulfhydryl groups can be generated by reaction of an amino group of a lysine moiety of a Ligand using 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent or another sulfhydryl generating reagent.

In one embodiment the Stretcher unit forms a bond with a sulfur atom of the Ligand unit. The sulfur atom can be derived from a sulfhydryl group of a Ligand. Representative Stretcher units of this embodiment are depicted within the square brackets of Formulas IIIa and IIIb wherein L W Y D w and y are as defined above and Ris selected from C Calkylene C Ccarbocyclo O C Calkyl arylene C Calkylene arylene arylene C Calkylene C Calkylene C Ccarbocyclo C Ccarbocyclo C Calkylene C Cheterocyclo C Calkylene C Cheterocyclo C Cheterocyclo C Calkylene CHCHO and CHCHO CH and r is an integer ranging from 1 10.

The Spacer unit Y when present links an Amino Acid unit to the Drug unit when an Amino Acid unit is present. Alternately the Spacer unit links the Stretcher unit to the Drug unit when the Amino Acid unit is absent. The Spacer unit also links the Drug unit to the ligand unit when both the Amino Acid unit and Stretcher unit are absent. Spacer units are of two general types self immolative and non self immolative. A non self immolative Spacer unit is one in which part or all of the Spacer unit remains bound to the Drug unit after cleavage particularly enzymatic of an Amino Acid unit from the Drug Linker Ligand Conjugate or the Drug Linker Compound. Examples of a non self immolative Spacer unit include but are not limited to a glycine glycine Spacer unit and a glycine Spacer unit both depicted in Scheme 1 .

Elimination of amine containing drugs that are substituted at the a position of glycine Kingsbury et al. 1984 27 1447 are also examples of self immolative spacer useful in the Compounds of the Invention.

A Drug unit can form a bond with a Linker unit via a nitrogen atom of a Drug s primary or secondary amino group via an oxygen atom of a Drug s hydroxyl group or via a sulfur atom of a Drug s sulfhydryl group to form a Drug Linker Compound.

The Ligand unit L includes within its scope any unit of a Ligand L that binds or reactively associates or complexes with a receptor antigen or other receptive moiety associated with a given target cell population. A Ligand can be any molecule that binds to complexes with or reacts with a moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified. The Ligand unit acts to deliver the Drug unit to the particular target cell population with which the Ligand unit reacts. Such Ligands include but are not limited to large molecular weight proteins such as for example full length antibodies antibody fragments smaller molecular weight proteins polypeptide or peptides and lectins.

A Ligand unit can form a bond to either a Stretcher unit or an Amino Acid unit of a Linker. A Ligand unit can form a bond to a Linker unit via a heteroatom of the Ligand. Heteroatoms that may be present on a Ligand unit include sulfur in one embodiment from a sulfhydryl group of a Ligand oxygen in one embodiment from a carbonyl carboxyl or hydroxyl group of a Ligand and nitrogen in one embodiment from a primary or secondary amino group of a Ligand . These heteroatoms can be present on the Ligand in the Ligand s natural state for example a naturally occurring antibody or can be introduced into the Ligand via chemical modification.

In another embodiment the Ligand can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be chemically modified to have one or more sulfhydryl groups. The Ligand unit bonds to the Stretcher unit via the sulfhydryl group s sulfur atom.

Useful Polyclonal antibody Ligands are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of immunized animals. Various procedures well known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to an antigen of interest. For example for the production of polyclonal antibodies various host animals can be immunized by injection with an antigen of interest or derivative thereof including but not limited to rabbits mice rats and guinea pigs. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species and including but not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.

Useful monoclonal antibody Ligands are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigen e.g. a cancer cell antigen a viral antigen a microbial antigen covalently linked to a second molecule . A monoclonal antibody mAb to an antigen of interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein 1975256 495 497 the human B cell hybridoma technique Kozbor et al. 1983 4 72 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al. 1985 Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 . Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG IgM IgE IgA and IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAbs of use in this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo.

Useful monoclonal antibody Ligands include but are not limited to human monoclonal antibodies or chimeric human mouse or other species monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art e.g. Teng et al. 198380 7308 7312 Kozbor et al. 19834 72 79 and Olsson et al. 198292 3 16 .

The Ligand can also be a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Milstein et al. 1983305 537 539 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually performed using affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in International Publication No. WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different and more preferred approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies have a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation International Publication No. WO 94 04690 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

For further details for generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 1986 121 210. Using such techniques bispecific antibody Ligands can be prepared for use in the treatment or prevention of disease as defined herein.

Bifunctional antibodies are also described in European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 105 360. As disclosed in this reference hybrid or bifunctional antibodies can be derived either biologically i.e. by cell fusion techniques or chemically especially with cross linking agents or disulfide bridge forming reagents and may comprise whole antibodies or fragments thereof. Methods for obtaining such hybrid antibodies are disclosed for example in International Publication WO 83 03679 and European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 217 577 both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The Ligand can be a functionally active fragment derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to cancer cell antigens viral antigens or microbial antigens. In this regard Functionally active means that the fragment derivative or analog is able to elicit anti anti idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically in a preferred embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art e.g. the BIA core assay 

Other useful Ligands include fragments of antibodies such as but not limited to F ab 2 fragments which contain the variable region the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab 2 fragments. Other useful Ligands are heavy chain and light chain dimers of antibodies or any minimal fragment thereof such as Fvs or single chain antibodies SCAs e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 Bird 1988 242 423 42 Huston et al. 198885 5879 5883 and Ward et al. 1989 334 544 54 or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody.

Additionally recombinant antibodies such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies comprising both human and non human portions which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques are useful Ligands. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and a human immunoglobulin constant region. See e.g. Cabilly et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Boss et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 397 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non human species having one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from the non human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. See e.g. Queen U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art for example using methods described in International Publication No. WO 87 02671 European Patent Publication No. 184 187 European Patent Publication No. 171 496 European Patent Publication No. 173 494 International Publication No. WO 86 01533 U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 European Patent Publication No. 125 023 Berter et al. 1988 240 1041 1043 Liu et al. 198784 3439 3443 Liu et al. 1987139 3521 3526 Sun et al. 198784 214 218 Nishimura et al. 1987 47 999 1005 Wood et al. 1985 314 446 449 and Shaw et al. 198880 1553 1559 Morrison 1985 229 1202 1207 Oi et al. 1986 4 214 U.S. Pat. No. 5 225 539 Jones et al. 1986 321 552 525 Verhoeyan et al. 1988 239 1534 and Beidler et al. 1988141 4053 4060 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for Ligands. Such antibodies can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar 199513 65 93 . For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 625 126 U.S. Pat. No. 5 633 425 U.S. Pat. No. 5 569 825 U.S. Pat. No. 5 661 016 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 545 806 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other human antibodies can be obtained commercially from for example Abgenix Inc. Freemont Calif. and Genpharm San Jose Calif. .

Completely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as guided selection. In this approach a selected non human monoclonal antibody e.g. a mouse antibody is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. Jespers et al. 1994 12 899 903 .

In other embodiments the Ligand is a fusion protein of an antibody or a functionally active fragment thereof for example in which the antibody is fused via a covalent bond e.g. a peptide bond at either the N terminus or the C terminus to an amino acid sequence of another protein or portion thereof preferably at least 10 20 or 50 amino acid portion of the protein that is not the antibody. Preferably the antibody or fragment thereof is covalently linked to the other protein at the N terminus of the constant domain.

The Ligand antibodies include analogs and derivatives that are either modified i.e by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule as long as such covalent attachment permits the antibody to retain its antigen binding immunospecificity. For example but not by way of limitation the derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified e.g. by glycosylation acetylation pegylation phosphylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to a cellular Ligand unit or other protein etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage acetylation formylation metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin etc. Additionally the analog or derivative can contain one or more unnaturalamino acids.

The Ligand antibodies include antibodies having modifications e.g. substitutions deletions or additions in amino acid residues that interact with Fc receptors. In particular the Ligand antibodies include antibodies having modifications in amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc domain and the FcRn receptor see e.g. International Publication No. WO 97 34631 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . Antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially for example from Genentech San Francisco Calif. or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as e.g. chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained e.g. from the GenBank database or a database like it the literature publications or by routine cloning and sequencing.

In another specific embodiment useful Ligand antibodies that are immunospecific for a viral or a microbial antigen are monoclonal antibodies. Preferably Ligand antibodies that are immunospecific for a viral antigen or microbial antigen are humanized or human monoclonal antibodies. As used herein the term viral antigen includes but is not limited to any viral peptide polypeptide protein e.g. HIV gp120 HIV nef RSV F glycoprotein influenza virus neuraminidase influenza virus hemagglutinin HTLV tax herpes simplex virus glycoprotein e.g. gB gC gD and gE and hepatitis B surface antigen that is capable of eliciting an immune response.

Other antibodies useful in this invention for treatment of viral disease include but are not limited to antibodies against antigens of pathogenic viruses including as examples and not by limitation Poxyiridae Herpesviridae Herpes Simplex virus 1 Herpes Simplex virus 2 Adenoviridae Papovaviridae Enteroviridae Picornaviridae Parvoviridae Reoviridae Retroviridae influenza viruses parainfluenza viruses mumps measles respiratory syncytial virus rubella Arboviridae Rhabdoviridae Arenaviridae Hepatitis A virus Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis C virus Hepatitis E virus Non A Non B Hepatitis virus Rhinoviridae Coronaviridae Rotoviridae and Human Immunodeficiency Virus.

The antibodies suitable for use in the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies in particular by chemical synthesis or by recombinant expression and are preferably produced by recombinant expression techniques.

Ligand antibodies of the invention can be produced using any method known in the art to be useful for the synthesis of antibodies in particular by chemical synthesis or by recombinant expression and are preferably produced by recombinant expression techniques.

Recombinant expression of the Ligand antibodies or fragment derivative or analog thereof requires construction of a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody. If the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known a nucleic acid encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. 1994 17 242 which involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligation of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

Alternatively a nucleic acid molecule encoding an antibody can be generated from a suitable source. If a clone containing the nucleic acid encoding the particular antibody is not available but the sequence of the antibody is known a nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be obtained from a suitable source e.g. an antibody cDNA library or cDNA library generated from any tissue or cells expressing the immunoglobulin by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3 and 5 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence.

If an antibody that specifically recognizes a particular antigen is not commercially available or a source for a cDNA library for cloning a nucleic acid encoding such an immunoglobulin antibodies specific for a particular antigen can be generated by any method known in the art for example by immunizing an animal such as a rabbit to generate polyclonal antibodies or more preferably by generating monoclonal antibodies e.g. as described by Kohler and Milstein 1975 256 495 497 or as described by Kozbor et al. 19834 72 or Cole et al. 1985 in Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 . Alternatively a clone encoding at least the Fab portion of the antibody can be obtained by screening Fab expression libraries e.g. as described in Huse et al. 1989 246 1275 1281 for clones of Fab fragments that bind the specific antigen or by screening antibody libraries See e.g. Clackson et al. 1991 352 624 Hane et al. 1997 94 4937 .

Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least the variable domain of the antibody is obtained it can be introduced into a vector containing the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant regions of the antibody see e.g. International Publication No. WO 86 05807 International Publication No. WO 89 01036 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 464 . Vectors containing the complete light or heavy chain that allow for the expression of a complete antibody molecule are available. Then the nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be used to introduce the nucleotide substitutions or deletion necessary to substitute or delete the one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond with an amino acid residue that does not contain a sulfhydryl group. Such modifications can be carried out by any method known in the art for the introduction of specific mutations or deletions in a nucleotide sequence for example but not limited to chemical mutagenesis and in vitro site directed mutagenesis Hutchinson et al. 1978 253 6551 .

In addition techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies Morrison et al. 198481 851 855 Neuberger et al. 1984 312 604 608 Takeda et al. 1985 314 452 454 by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region e.g. humanized antibodies.

Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 694 778 Bird 1988 242 423 42 Huston et al. 1988 85 5879 5883 and Ward et al. 1989 334 544 54 can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used Skerra et al. 1988 242 1038 1041 .

Antibody fragments that recognize specific epitopes can be generated by known techniques. For example such fragments include but are not limited to the F ab 2 fragments that can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the Fab fragments that can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab 2 fragments.

Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding a Ligand antibody has been obtained the vector for the production of the antibody can be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods that are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. See for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 19902Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 John Wiley Sons NY .

An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of an antibody or the nucleotide sequence of an antibody can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques e.g. electroporation liposomal transfection and calcium phosphate precipitation and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the antibody. In specific embodiments the expression of the antibody is regulated by a constitutive an inducible or a tissue specific promoter.

The host cells used to express the recombinant Ligand antibody can be either bacterial cells such as or preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins Foecking et al. 19845 101 Cockett et al. 1990 8 2 .

A variety of host expression vector systems can be utilized to express the immunoglobulin Ligands. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the antibody can be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells that can when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express a Ligand immunoglobulin molecule in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. and transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing immunoglobulin coding sequences yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing immunoglobulin coding sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing the immunoglobulin coding sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV and tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing immunoglobulin coding sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BH 293 293T 3T3 cells harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter .

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors can be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced vectors that direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified might be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. 1983 2 1791 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye 1985 13 3101 3109 Van Heeke Schuster 198924 5503 5509 and the like. pGEX vectors can also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV or the analogous virus from is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence can be cloned individually into non essential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems can be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest can be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene can then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 results in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts. e.g. see Logan Shenk 198481 355 359 . Specific initiation signals can also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression can be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see Bittner et al. 1987153 51 544 .

In addition a host cell strain can be chosen to modulate the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products can be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells that possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product can be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BH Hela COS MDCK 293 293T 3T3 W138 BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT20 and T47D CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines that stably express an antibody can be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors that contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells can be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci that in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method can advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody Such engineered cell lines can be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of tumor antigens that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody Ligand.

A number of selection systems can be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. 1977 11 223 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski 19248 202 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 1980 22 817 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 198077 357 O Hare et al. 198178 1527 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg 198178 2072 neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 12 488 505 Wu and Wu 1991 3 87 95 Tolstoshev 1993 32 573 596 Mulligan 1993 260 926 932 and Morgan and Anderson 1993 62 191 217 May 1993 11 5 155 215 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin Santerre et al. 198430 147 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. eds. 1993 John Wiley Sons NY Kriegler 1990 Stockton Press NY and in Chapters 12 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds 1994 John Wiley Sons NY. Colberre Garapin et al. 1981150 1 .

The expression levels of an antibody can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel Vol. 3. Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing an antibody is amplifiable an increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the nucleotide sequence of the antibody production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. 19833 257 .

The host cell can be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors can contain identical selectable markers that enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector can be used to encode both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot 1986 322 52 Kohler 1980 77 2197 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains can comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

Once the antibody has been recombinantly expressed it can be purified using any method known in the art for purification of an antibody for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.

In any case the hybrid antibodies have a dual specificity preferably with one or more binding sites specific for the hapten of choice or one or more binding sites specific for a target antigen for example an antigen associated with a tumor an autoimmune disease an infectious organism or other disease state.

As described in more detail below the Compounds of the Invention are conveniently prepared using a Linker having two or more Reactive Sites for binding to the Drug and Ligand. In one aspect of the invention a Linker has a Reactive site which has an electrophilic group that is reactive to a nucleophilic group present on a Ligand. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Ligand include but are not limited to sulfhydryl hydroxyl and amino groups. The heteroatom of the nucleophilic group of a Ligand is reactive to an electrophilic group on a Linker and forms a covalent bond to a Linker unit. Useful electrophilic groups include but are not limited to maleimide and haloacetamide groups. The electrophilic group provides a convenient site for Ligand attachment.

In another embodiment a Linker has a Reactive site which has a nucleophilic group that is reactive to an electrophilic group present on a Ligand. Useful electrophilic groups on a Ligand include but are not limited to aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on a Ligand and form a covalent bond to a Ligand unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include but are not limited to hydrazide oxime amino hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on a Ligand provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.

Carboxylic acid functional groups and chloroformate functional groups are also useful reactive sites for a Linker because they can react with primary or secondary amino groups of a Drug to form an amide linkage. Also useful as a reactive site is a carbonate functional group on a Linker which can react with an amino group or hydroxyl group of a Drug to form a carbamate linkage or carbonate linkage respectively. Similarly a Drug s phenol moiety can react with the Linker existing as an alcohol under Mitsunobu conditions.

Typically peptide based Drugs can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schr der and K. L bke The Peptides volume 1 pp 76 136 1965 Academic Press that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry.

In one embodiment a Drug is prepared by combining about a stoichiometric equivalent of a dipeptide and a tripeptide preferably in a one pot reaction under suitable condensation conditions. This approach is illustrated in the following Schemes 5 7. Thus the tripeptide 6 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 5 and the dipeptide 9 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 6. The two fragments 6 and 9 can be condensed to provide a Drug 10 as shown in Scheme 7.

The synthesis of an illustrative Stretcher having an electrophilic maleimide group is illustrated in Schemes 8 9. General synthetic methods useful for the synthesis of a Linker are described in Scheme 10. Scheme 11 shows the construction of a Linker unit having a val cit group an electrophilic maleimide group and a PAB self immolative Spacer group. Scheme 12 depicts the synthesis of a Linker having a phe lys group an electrophilic maleimide group with and without the PAB self immolative Spacer group. Scheme 13 presents a general outline for the synthesis of a Drug Linker Compound while Scheme 14 presents an alternate route for preparing a Drug Linker Compound. Scheme 15 depicts the synthesis of a branched linker containing a BHMS group. Scheme 16 outlines the attachment of a Ligand to a Drug Linker Compound to form a Drug Linker Ligand Conjugate and Scheme 17 illustrates the synthesis of Drug Linker Ligand Conjugates having 2 or 4 drugs per Ligand.

As illustrated in Scheme 5 a protected amino acid 1 where PG represents an amine protecting group Ris selected from hydrogen C Calkyl C Ccarbocycle O C Calkyl aryl alkyl aryl alkyl C Ccarbocycle C Cheterocycle alkyl C Cheterocycle wherein Ris selected from H and methyl or Rand Rjoin have the formula CRR wherein Rand Rare independently selected from hydrogen C Calkyl and C Ccarbocycle and n is selected from 2 3 4 5 and 6 and form a ring with the carbon atom to which they are attached is coupled to t butyl ester 2 where Ris selected from H and C Calkyl and Ris selected from hydrogen C Calkyl C Ccarbocycle O C Calkyl aryl alkyl aryl alkyl C Ccarbocycle C Cheterocycle and alkyl C Cheterocycle under suitable coupling conditions e.g. in the presence of PyBrop and diisopropylethylamine or using DCC see for example Miyazaki K. et. al. 1995 43 10 1706 1718 .

Suitable protecting groups PG and suitable synthetic methods to protect an amino group with a protecting group are well known in the art. See e.g. Greene T. W. and Wuts P.G.M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 2nd Edition 1991 John Wiley Sons. Preferred protected amino acids 1 are PG Ile and particularly PG Val while other suitable protected amino acids include without limitation PG cyclohexylglycine PG cyclohexylalanine PG aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid PG aminoisobutyric acid PG phenylalanine PG phenylglycine and PG tert butylglycine. Z is a preferred protecting group. Fmoc is another preferred protecting group. A preferred t butyl ester 2 is dolaisoleuine t butyl ester.

The dipeptide 3 can be purified e.g. using chromatography and subsequently deprotected e.g. using Hand 10 Pd C in ethanol when PG is benzyloxycarbonyl or using diethylamine for removal of an Fmoc protecting group. The resulting amine 4 readily forms a peptide bond with an amino acid 5 where Ris selected from H C Calkyl and C Ccarbocycle and Ris selected from H and C Calkyl or Rand Rjoin have the formula CRR wherein Rand Rare independently selected from H C Calkyl and C Ccarbocycle and n is selected from 2 3 4 5 and 6 and form a ring with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached and Ris selected from hydrogen C Calkyl C Ccarbocycle O C Calkyl aryl alkyl aryl alkyl C Ccarbocycle C Cheterocycle and alkyl C Cheterocycle . N N Dialkyl amino acids are preferred amino acids 5 such as commercially available N N dimethyl valine. Other N N dialkyl amino acids can be prepared by reductive bis alkylation using known procedures see e.g. Bowman R. E Stroud H. H 1950 1342 1340 . Fmoc Me L Val and Fmoc Me L glycine are two preferred amino acids 5 useful for the synthesis of N monoalkyl derivatives. The amine 4 and the amino acid 5 react to provide the tripeptide 6 using coupling reagent DEPC with triethylamine as the base.

Illustrative DEPC coupling methodology and the PyBrop coupling methodology shown in Scheme 5 are outlined below in General Procedure A and General Procedure B respectively. Illustrative methodology for the deprotection of a Z protected amine via catalytic hydrogenation is outlined below in General Procedure C.

General Procedure A Peptide synthesis using DEPC. The N protected or N N disubstituted amino acid or peptide 4 1.0 eq. and an amine 5 1.1 eq. are diluted with an aprotic organic solvent such as dichloromethane 0.1 to 0.5 M . An organic base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine 1.5 eq. is then added followed by DEPC 1.1 eq. . The resulting solution is stirred preferably under argon for up to 12 hours while being monitored by HPLC or TLC. The solvent is removed in vacuo at room temperature and the crude product is purified using for example HPLC or flash column chromatography silica gel column . Relevant fractions are combined and concentrated in vacuo to afford tripeptide 6 which is dried under vacuum overnight.

General procedure B Peptide synthesis using PyBrop. The amino acid 2 1.0 eq. optionally having a carboxyl protecting group is diluted with an aprotic organic solvent such as dichloromethane or DME to provide a solution of a concentration between 0.5 and 1.0 mM then diisopropylethylamine 1.5 eq. is added. Fmoc or Z protected amino acid 1 1.1 eq. is added as a solid in one portion then PyBrop 1.2 eq. is added to the resulting mixture.

Illustrative methods useful for linking a Drug to a Ligand to form a Drug Linker Compound are depicted in Scheme 13 and are outlined in General Procedures G J.

General Procedure G Amide formation using HATU. A Drug 10 1.0 eq. and an N protected Linker containing a carboxylic acid Reactive site 1.0 eq. are diluted with a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane and the resulting solution is treated with HATU 1.5 eq. and an organic base preferably pyridine 1.5 eq. .

The reaction mixture is then concentrated in vacuo and the resulting residue is purified using for example HPLC to yield the carbamate 32.

General Procedure I Ether formation using Mitsunobu chemistry. A Drug of general formula 10 which contains a free hydroxyl group is diluted with THF to make a 1.0 M solution and to this solution is added a Linker 1.0 eq containing an hydroxy group at Reactive site No. 1 33 followed by triphenylphosphine 1.5 eq. . The reaction mixture is put under an argon atmosphere and cooled to 0 C.

The reaction is typically complete in 0.5 12 h depending on the substrates. The reaction mixture is diluted with water in volume equal to that of the THF and the reaction mixture is extracted into EtOAc. The EtOAc layer is washed sequentially with water and brine then dried over MgSOand concentrated. The resulting residue is purified via flash column chromatography using a suitable eluent to provide ether 34.

General Procedure J Ether amine Formation via Nucleophilic Substitution. A Drug of general formula 10 which contains a free hydroxyl group or a free amine group is diluted with a polar aprotic solvent such as THF DMF or DMSO to make a 1.0 M solution and to this solution is added a non nucleophilic base about 1.5 eq such as pyridine diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine.

An alternate method of preparing Drug Linker Compounds of the invention is outlined in Scheme 14. Using the method of Scheme 14 the Drug is attached to a partial Linker unit 19a for example which does not have a Stretcher unit attached. This provides intermediate 35 which has an Amino Acid unit having an Fmoc protected N terminus. The Fmoc group is then removed and the resulting amine intermediate 36 is then attached to a Stretcher unit via a coupling reaction catalyzed using PyBrop or DEPC. The construction of Drug Linker Compounds containing either a bromoacetamide Stretcher 39 or a PEG maleimide Stretcher 38 is illustrated in Scheme 14.

Methodology useful for the preparation of a Linker unit containing a branched spacer is shown in Scheme 15.

Scheme 15 illustrates the synthesis of a val cit dipeptide linker having a maleimide Stretcher unit and a bis 4 hydroxymethyl styrene BHMS unit. The synthesis of the BHMS intermediate 75 has been improved from previous literature procedures see International Publication No WO 9813059 to Firestone et al. and Crozet M. P. Archaimbault G. Vanelle P. Nouguier R. 1985 26 5133 5134 and utilizes as starting materials commercially available diethyl 4 nitrobenzyl phosphonate 72 and commercially available 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxan 5 one 73 . Linkers 77 and 79 can be prepared from intermediate 75 using the methodology described in Scheme 11.

Scheme 16 illustrates methodology useful for making Drug Linker Ligand conjugates of the invention having about 2 to about 4 drugs per antibody.

In general to prepare conjugates having 2 drugs per antibody the relevant antibody is reduced using a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol DTT or tricarbonyl ethylphosphine TCEP about 1.8 equivalents in PBS with 1 mM DTPA adjusted to pH 8 with 50 mM borate. The solution is incubated at 37 C. for 1 hour purified using a 50 ml G25 desalting column equilibrated in PBS 1 mM DTPA at 4 C. The thiol concentration can be determined according to General Procedure M the protein concentration can be determined by dividing the A280 value by 1.58 extinction coefficient mg ml and the ratio of thiol to antibody can be determined according to General Procedure N.

Conjugates having 4 drugs per antibody can be made using the same methodology using about 4.2 equivalents of a suitable reducing agent to partially reduce the antibody.

The partially reduced antibody samples can be conjugated to a corresponding Drug Linker compound using about 2.4 and about 4.6 molar equivalents of Drug Linker compound per antibody to prepare the 2 and 4 drug per antibody conjugates respectively. The conjugation reactions are incubated on ice for 1 hour quenched with about 20 fold excess of cysteine to drug and purified by elution over a G25 desalting column at about 4 C. The resulting Drug Linker Ligand conjugates are concentrated to about 3 mg ml sterile filtered aliquoted and stored frozen.

Scheme 17 depicts the construction of a Drug Linker Ligand Conjugate by reacting the sulfhydryl group of a Ligand with a thiol acceptor group on the Linker group of a Drug Linker Compound.

Illustrative methods for attaching a Ligand antibody to a Drug Linker Compound are outlined below in General Procedures L R.

General Procedure L Attachment of an Antibody Ligand to a Drug Linker Compound. All reaction steps are typically carried out at 4 C. Where the Ligand is a monoclonal antibody having one or more disulfide bonds solutions of the monoclonal antibody 5 20 mg mL in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.2 are reduced with dithiothreitol 10 mM final at 37 C. for 30 minutes See General Procedure M and separation of low molecular weight agents is achieved by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G25 columns in PBS containing 1 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid.

The sulfhydryl content in the Ligand can be determined using 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid DTNB as described in General Procedure M see Riddles P. W. Blakeley R. L. and Zerner B. 1979 Anal. Biochem. 94 75 81 . To a PBS solution of Ligand reduced according to General Procedure L a Drug Linker Compound in MeCN is added so that the solution is 20 MeCN PBS vol vol . The amount of Drug Linker Compound is approximately 10 more than the total number of sulfhydryl groups on a Ligand. After 60 min at 4 C. cysteine is added 20 fold excess over concentration of the Drug Linker Compound the solution is concentrated by ultrafiltration and any low molecular weight agents are removed by gel filtration. The number of Drug Linker Compounds per antibody is determined by uv vis spectroscopy using formulas derived from the relative extinction coefficients of the Ligands and Drug Linker Compounds as described in General Procedure O. The amount of quenched Drug Linker Compound is then determined as described in General Procedure P using reverse phase HPLC. The aggregation state of the Ligand Antibodies of the Drug Linker Ligand Conjugates can be determined using size exclusion HPLC as described in General Procedure R. The Drug Linker Ligand Conjugates can be used without further purification.

General Procedure M Reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds of an Antibody. To a solution of 24 mg of an antibody 2.4 mL of 10 mg mL solution in suitable buffer is added 300 L of Borate buffer 500 mM sodium borate 500 mM sodium chloride pH 8.0 followed by 300 L of Dithiothreitol DTT 100 mM solution in HO . The reaction mixture is stirred using a vortex instrument and incubated at 37 C. for 30 min. Three PD10 columns are equilibrated with PBS containing 1 mM DTPA in PBS and the reduced antibody is eluted through the three PD10 columns and collected in 4.2 mL PBS DTPA solution 1.4 mL per column . The reduced antibody is then stored on ice. The number of thiols per antibody and the antibody concentration are determined according to General Procedure N.

A reference sample of a Ligand or a sample of an antibody reduced according to General Procedure L is diluted to about 1 40 w w in PBS and the uv absorbance of the solution is measured at 280 nm using standard uv spectroscopic methods.

Preferably the ratio of Ligand PBS in the solution is such that the uv absorbance ranges from about 0.13 0.2 AU absorbance units .

A test sample of a Ligand or a test sample of an antibody reduced according to General Procedure L is diluted to about 1 20 with a PBS solution containing about 15 L DTNB stock solution mL PBS. A blank sample containing DTNB at the same concentration as the test solution i.e. 15 L DTNB stock mL PBS is then prepared. The spectrophotometer is referenced at zero nm with the blank sample then the absorbance of the test sample is measured at 412 nm.

The molar concentration of the antibody is then determined using the formula Ligand OD 2.24e dilution factor.

The SH Ligand ratio is then calculated. A reduced monoclonal antibody Ligand can have from 1 to about 20 sulfhydryl groups but typically has between about 6 to about 9 sulfhydryl groups. In a preferred embodiment the SH Ligand ratio range is from about 7 to about 9.

General Procedure O Determination of the number of Drug molecules per Antibody in a Drug Linker Antibody Conjugate. The Drug Antibody ratio for a Drug Linker Antibody Conjugate is determined by measuring the number of Dithiothreitol DTT reducible thiols that remain after conjugation using the following method A 200 mL sample of a Drug Linker Antibody conjugate is treated with DTT 100 mM solution in water to bring the concentration to 10 mM DTT. The resulting solution is incubated at 37 C. for 30 min then eluted through a PD10 column using PBS DTPA as the eluent. The ODof the reduced conjugate is then measured and the molar concentration is measured according to General Procedure Q.

The molar concentration of thiol is determined using DTNB as described in General Procedure M. The ratio of thiol concentration to antibody concentration is then calculated and the Drug Ligand ratio is the difference between the Thiol Antibody ratio determined using General Procedure N and the Drug Antibody ratio as determined in the previous paragraph.

General Procedure P Determination of the amount of quenched Drug Linker compound in a Drug Linker Antibody Conjugate. This assay provides a quantitative determination of the Drug Linker in the Drug Linker Antibody conjugate that is not covalently bound to Antibody. Assuming that all maleimide groups of Drug Linker in the reaction mixture have been quenched with Cysteine the unbound drug is the Cysteine quenched adduct of the Drug Linker Compound i.e. Drug Linker Cys. The proteinaceous Drug Linker Antibody Conjugate is denatured precipitated and isolated by centrifugation under conditions in which the Drug Linker Cys is soluble. The unbound Drug Linker Cys is detected quantitatively by HPLC and the resulting chromatogram is compared to a standard curve to determine the concentration of unbound Drug Linker Cys in the sample. This concentration is divided by the total concentration of Drug in the conjugate as determined using General Procedure O and General Procedure Q.

Specifically 100 mL of a 100 M Drug Linker Cys adduct working solution is prepared by adding 1 L of 100 mM Cysteine in PBS DTPA and an appropriate volume of stock solution of a Drug Linker compound to 98 L of 50 methanol PBS. The appropriate volume in liters is calculated using the formula V 1e 8 Drug Linker . Six tubes are then labelled as follows 0 0.5 1 2 3 and 5 and appropriate amounts of working solution are placed in each tube and diluted with 50 methanol PBS to give a total volume of 100 mL in each tube. The labels indicate the M concentration of the standards.

A 50 L solution of a Drug Linker Antibody Conjugate and a 50 L solution of the Cysteine quenched reaction mixture qrm are collected in separate test tubes and are each diluted with 50 L of methanol that has been cooled to 20 C. The samples are then cooled to 20 C. over 10 min.

The samples are then centrifuged at 13000 rpm in a desktop centrifuge for 10 min. The supernatants are transferred to HPLC vials and 90 L aliquots of each sample are separately analyzed using HPLC C12 RP column Phenomenex monitored at the absorbance maximum of the Drug Linker Compound using a flow rate of 1.0 mL min. The eluent used is a linear gradient of MeCN ranging from 10 to 90 in aqueous 5 mM ammonium phosphate pH 7.4 over 10 min then 90 MeCN over 5 min. then returning to initial conditions . The Drug Linker Cys adduct typically elutes between about 7 and about 10 minutes.

A standard curve is then prepared by plotting the Peak Area of the standards vs. their concentration in M . Linear regression analysis is performed to determine the equation and correlation coefficient of the standard curve. Rvalues are typically 0.99. From the regression equation is determined the concentration of the Drug Linker Cys adduct in the HPLC sample and in the conjugate using the formulas Drug Linker Cys Peak area intercept slope Drug Linker Cys 2 Drug Linker Cys 

The percent of Drug Linker Cys adduct present can be determined using the formula Drug Linker Cys 100 Drug Linker Cys drug 

General Procedure Q Determination of Drug Linker Antibody Conjugate concentration for drug linkers with minimal uv absorbance at 280 nm. The concentration of Drug Linker Antibody conjugate can be determined in the same manner for the concentration of the parent antibody by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm of an appropriate dilution using the following formula Conjugate mg mL OD dilution factor 1.4 0.9

Determination of Drug Linker Antibody Conjugate concentration for drug linkers with substantial uv absorbance at 280 nm e.g. Compounds 68 and 69 . Because the absorbances of Compounds 68 and 69 overlap with the absorbances of an antibody spectrophotometric determination of the conjugate concentration is most useful when the measurement is performed using the absorbances at both 270 nm and 280 nm. Using this data the molar concentration of Drug Linker Ligand conjugate is given by the following formula Conjugate OD 1.23 OD 9.35 dilution factor

General Procedure R Determination of the aggregation state of The Antibody in a Drug Linker Antibody Conjugate. A suitable quantity 10 g of a Drug Linker Antibody Conjugate is eluted through a size exclusion chromatography SEC column Tosoh Biosep SW3000 4.6 mm 30 cm eluted at 0.35 mL min. with PBS under standard conditions. Chromatograms are obtained at 220 nm and 280 nm and the OD ODratio is calculated. The corresponding aggregate typically has a retention time of between about 5.5 and about 7 min and has about the same OD ODratio as the monomeric Drug Linker Antibody Conjugate.

The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant or excipient with which a Compound of the Invention is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. The carriers can be saline gum acacia gelatin starch paste talc keratin colloidal silica urea and the like. In addition auxiliary stabilizing thickening lubricating and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment when administered to an animal the Compounds of the Invention or compositions and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sterile. Water is a preferred carrier when the Compounds of the Invention are administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers also include excipients such as starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The present compositions if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents.

The present compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills pellets capsules capsules containing liquids powders sustained release formulations suppositories emulsions aerosols sprays suspensions or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is a capsule see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 698 155 . Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin.

In a preferred embodiment the Compounds of the Invention are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to animals particularly human beings. Typically the carriers or vehicles for intravenous administration are sterile isotonic aqueous buffer solutions. Where necessary the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally comprise a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form for example as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where a Compound of the Invention is to be administered by infusion it can be dispensed for example with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the Compound of the Invention is administered by injection an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.

Compositions for oral delivery can be in the form of tablets lozenges aqueous or oily suspensions granules powders emulsions capsules syrups or elixirs for example. Orally administered compositions can contain one or more optionally agents for example sweetening agents such as fructose aspartame or saccharin flavoring agents such as peppermint oil of wintergreen or cherry coloring agents and preserving agents to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover where in tablet or pill form the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compounds. In these later platforms fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be used. Oral compositions can include standard carriers such as mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate etc. Such carriers are preferably of pharmaceutical grade.

The compositions can be intended for topical administration in which case the carrier may be in the form of a solution emulsion ointment or gel base. The base for example can comprise one or more of the following petrolatum lanolin polyethylene glycols beeswax mineral oil diluents such as water and alcohol and emulsifiers and stabilizers. Thickening agents can be present in a composition for topical administration. If intended for transdermal administration the composition can be in the form of a transdermal patch or an iontophoresis device. Topical formulations can comprise a concentration of a Compound of the Invention of from about 0.1 to about 10 w v weight per unit volume of composition .

The composition can be intended for rectal administration in the form e.g. of a suppository which will melt in the rectum and release the Compound of the Invention. The composition for rectal administration can contain an oleaginous base as a suitable nonirritating excipient. Such bases include without limitation lanolin cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol.

The composition can include various materials that modify the physical form of a solid or liquid dosage unit. For example the composition can include materials that form a coating shell around the active ingredients. The materials that form the coating shell are typically inert and can be selected from for example sugar shellac and other enteric coating agents. Alternatively the active ingredients can be encased in a gelatin capsule.

The compositions can consist of gaseous dosage units e.g. it can be in the form of an aerosol. The term aerosol is used to denote a variety of systems ranging from those of colloidal nature to systems consisting of pressurized packages. Delivery can be by a liquefied or compressed gas or by a suitable pump system that dispenses the active ingredients. Aerosols of Compounds of the Invention can be delivered in single phase bi phasic or tri phasic systems in order to deliver the Compound s of the Invention. Delivery of the aerosol includes the necessary container activators valves subcontainers Spacers and the like which together can form a kit. Preferred aerosols can be determined by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation.

Whether in solid liquid or gaseous form the compositions of the present invention can comprise a pharmacological agent used in the treatment of cancer an autoimmune disease or an infectious disease.

The pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared using methodology well known in the pharmaceutical art. For example a composition intended to be administered by injection can be prepared by combining a Compound of the Invention with water so as to form a solution. A surfactant can be added to facilitate the formation of a homogeneous solution or suspension. Surfactants are compounds that non covalently interact with a Compound of the Invention so as to facilitate dissolution or homogeneous suspension of the active compound in the aqueous delivery system.

General Procedure S In Vivo Testing of Selected Drug Linker Antibody Conjugates. For the L2987 human adenocarcinoma cell line Athymic nude mice 8 10 weeks old were implanted with xenograft tumors or tumor cells. For the Karpas human anaplastic large cell lymphoma model CB 17 SCID mice were implanted subcutaneously with 5 10cells. In both tumor models therapy was initiated once the tumors reached an average volume of 100 mm. Groups of mice were injected with one of Compounds 66 69 in phosphate buffered saline intravenously every fours days for a total of 6 injections for L2987 animals and 2 injections for Karpas animals. Tumor volume was computed using the formula 0.5 longest dimension perpendicular dimension . Mice were removed from the study when their tumors were approximately 1000 mm at which point the average tumor sizes from the particular group were no longer plotted.

None of the animals treated at 0.25 mg kg had a regression although there was a delay in tumor growth compared to untreated controls for the animals treated with Compound 91 and Compound 67. Treatment of Karpas tumors with Compound 91 and Compound 67 at 0.5 mg kg given q4d 4 achieved 5 5 complete regressions and complete regressions respectively. A delay in tumor growth compared to untreated animals was observed for Compound 92 at 0.5 mg kg given q4d 4 but no complete regressions were obtained.

Efficacy was also tested in a subcutaneous Karpas model with selected compounds administered as a single dose. Compound 91 and Compound 67 were injected at single doses of 0.25 0.5 and 2.0 mg kg. At the dose of 0.25 mg kg there was no antitumor activity in either group and mean tumor volume did not deviate from the untreated controls. A delay in the tumor growth was demonstrated by both molecules at 0.5 mg kg but no complete regressions were obtained. Treating the mice with Compound 91 and Compound 67 at 2 mg kg achieved 100 complete regressions in both groups.

Compound 91 and Compound 67 were also compared in mice bearing subcutaneous L540cy human HD tumors treated q4d 4 with Compound 91 and Compound 67 at 1 and 3 mg kg. At 1 mg kg mice treated with Compound 91 and Compound 67 had significant delays in tumor growth compared to the untreated animals. Complete regressions were observed in mice administered with both Compound 91 and Compound 67 at 3 mg kg.
