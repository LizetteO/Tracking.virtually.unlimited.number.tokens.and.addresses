title: plants named ‘Dasjes’
abstract: A new distinct cultivar of plant named ‘DASJES’, characterized by its upright and inverted conical plant habit; green and gray-green foliage; decorative, composite-type inflorescence with about 250 white colored ray florets; and only about 5 to 10 disc florets per inflorescence which are white in color with green margin (almost 100% filled capitulae).

The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of plant botanically known as now of the Asteraceae family commonly known as Michaelmas Daisy and New York Aster and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name DASJES .

The new cultivar is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventor Bent Juhl JENSEN in Malling Denmark. The objective of the breeding program is to develop a new variety with uniform plant growth habit unique floret colors and good postproduction longevity.

The new cultivar originated from a cross made in a controlled breeding program by the inventor on Apr. 1 2005 in Malling Denmark. The female or seed parent is WHITE SWAN unpatented . The male or pollen parent is WHITE PRESTIGE unpatented described in terminated CPVO Grant No. 8521 . The new DASJES was discovered and selected by the inventor as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross in September of 2006 in a controlled environment in Malling Denmark. The selection of the new DASJES was based on its uniform plant growth habit and desirable inflorescence form and ray floret color.

Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar by vegetative tip cuttings was first performed in June of 2006 in Malling Denmark and has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new cultivar are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The new cultivar reproduces true to type.

The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of DASJES which in combination distinguish this as a new and distinct cultivar 

Plants of the new DASJES differ from plants of the parents WHITE SWAN unpatented and WHITE PRESTIGE unpatented described in terminated CPVO Grant No. 8521 in the characteristics described below 

Of the many commercial cultivars known to the present inventor the most similar in comparison to the new DASJES is VICTORIA DIANA patented U.S. Plant Pat. No. 13 359 and CPVO Grant 11802 in the characteristics described in Table 1.

The new DASJES has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype of the new cultivar may vary with variations in environment such as temperature light intensity and day length without any change in the genotype of the plant.

The aforementioned photographs together with the following observations measurements and values describe the new DASJES as grown in a glass covered greenhouse in Mailing Denmark under conditions which closely approximate those generally used in commercial practice. DASJES plants were grown in 9.5 cm pots in a heated and lighted glass covered greenhouse with the day temperatures ranging from 18 C. to 20 C. and the night temperature averaging 18 C. DASJES plants are grown under long day 20 hour photoperiodic treatments for five weeks followed by short day 12 hour photoperiodic treatments for five weeks. During the long day 20 hour photoperiodic treatments if ambient light level falls below 50 Wm a supplementary light at 200 Wmis applied. DASJES plants DASJES plants were pinched once and treated twice with the growth retardant Daminozide.

Color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart R.H.S. 4th Edition except where general colors of ordinary significance are used. Color values were taken under daylight conditions in Malling Denmark. The age of the DASJES plants shown in the photographs and described herein is about 10 weeks.
