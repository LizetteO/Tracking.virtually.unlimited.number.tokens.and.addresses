This invention was made with Government support under contract no. DE AC04 94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to the analysis of multi component mixtures and in particular to a method of multi dimensional moment analysis for the characterization of signal peaks that can be used to optimize the operation of an analytical system.

Analysis of multi component mixtures using various analytical techniques often results in data that can be represented as a signal that is a function of two or more dimensions or variables . An example is gas chromatography coupled with ion mobility spectrometry GC IMS where one dimension is ion drift time t in the IMS and the other dimension is real time elution t from the GC. Thus the signal can be mathematically represented as C t t . Such complexity has recently become relevant for IMS techniques that have responses in both the drift time and the real time dimensions.

A brief survey of the literature reveals a myriad of statistical two dimensional techniques that have application for such data sets. Among these techniques are factor analysis techniques such as principle component analysis PCA evolving factor analysis EFA classical least squares methods CLS inverse least squares methods ILS and a number of techniques derived from these approaches see A. de Juan and R. Tauler 1158 184 2007 E. V. Thomas and D. M. Haaland 62 10 1091 1990 K. P. Pleibner et al. 20 755 1999 D. M. Haaland and D. K. Melgaard 54 9 1303 2000 and N. D. Sidiropoulos et al. 48 8 2377 2000 . These approaches are generally designed to identify and quantify the concentration of a multi component mixture measured using an analytical tool.

However a need remains for a method to optimize the performance of an analytical system to provide a measurement with high quality and high fidelity. Accordingly the present invention is directed to a method to quantify for comparison the quality and fidelity of signal response peaks. The method will be referred to herein as two dimensional P clet analysis.

The present invention is directed to a method of multi dimensional moment analysis for the characterization of signal peaks comprising measuring two or more signal peaks having at least two different dimensions of an analytical system calculating a zero moment for each of the signal peaks calculating a first moment in each dimension for each of the signal peaks calculating a second moment in each dimension for each of the signal peaks and selecting an operating parameter of the analytical system based upon a ratio of the first and second moments of each signal peak. The ratio can comprise a P clet number. The operation of the analytical system can be optimized by selecting the operating parameter that corresponds to the signal peak having the highest P clet number. The analytical system can comprise an ion mobility spectrometer with a preconcentrator in which the signal peak is a two dimensional signal with drift time in the ion mobility spectrometer as a first dimension and real time desorption from that preconcentrator as a second dimension. Preferably the preconcentrator enables temperature stepped desorption using two or more heating steps.

With a two dimensional P clet analysis the quality and signal fidelity of peaks in a two dimensional experimental space can be analyzed and scored. This method is particularly useful in determining optimum operational parameters for an analytical system which requires the automated analysis of large numbers of analyte data peaks. The technique is developed from moment analysis of the peaks and single dimensional P clet theory. The two dimensional P clet analysis allows automated comparison of response peaks with differing shapes and amplitudes to be compared simultaneously in multicomponent mixtures. The method allows a direct automated comparison between the quality of the peaks in terms of peak shape and signal to noise ratio rather than to return a concentration and species analysis. It therefore provides a figure of merit in the form of a 2 D P clet number that allows direct comparison of the signal fidelity of two or more peaks that have neither the same amplitude nor the same general shape and allows the system to be tuned to optimize its performance.

The method is applicable to any similar data occurring in a multi dimensional space. The method can be used to optimize analytical systems including an ion mobility spectrometer that uses a temperature stepped desorption technique for the detection of explosive mixtures as described herein. However the method has more general applicability and can be used with the two dimensional gel analysis in biological systems hyphenated techniques such as gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry GC MS time frequency surface acoustic wave SAW tag data geophysical analysis instruments for geophysical terrain mapping navigation systems in mountainous areas and effluent plume monitoring systems for example.

The method of the present invention is directed to a multi dimensional moment analysis for the characterization of signal peaks comprising measuring two or more signal peaks having at least two different dimensions of an analytical system calculating a zero moment for each of the signal peaks calculating a first moment in each dimension for each of the signal peaks calculating a second moment in each dimension for each of the signal peaks and selecting an operating parameter of the analytical system based upon a ratio of the first and second moments of each signal peak. The first moment is related to the distance from the origin of the peak. The second moment is related to the statistical variance or sharpness of the peak. The ratio can comprise a two dimensional P clet number the ratio of the first moment squared divided by half the second moment squared.

The method of the present invention can be applied generally to the analysis of multi component mixtures using various analytical techniques. However the method will be described herein as applied to the characterization of signal peaks from an ion mobility spectrometer. Ion mobility spectroscopy is based on the atmospheric pressure ionization of a sample vapor and the subsequent separation of the individual ionized components or analytes of the sample mixture via electrophoresis as they are accelerated by an external electric field gradient and transit a time of flight drift tube against a neutral counter flowing gas stream. See G. A. Eiceman and Z. Karpas 2Ed. Chapter 4 2004 .

The drift time of an explosive ion or any ion is a complex function of its ionization mass collision cross section and ion stability see G. A. Eiceman and Z. Karpas 2nd Ed. pp. 1 9 2005 . Ions with different mobilities will reach a different terminal speed when an electric field is applied in the tube. Since there is a background gas in the tube molecular collisions occur as the ion moves under the influence of the electric field resulting in a constant speed of the ion that is proportional to the electric field magnitude. The proportionality constant is known as the ion mobility and leads to separation in the transit time through the IMS drift tube.

Most IMS explosives detection systems that incorporate preconcentrators heat the preconcentrator to between 180 C. and 200 C. in a single pulse which thermally desorbs the explosives that have been collected during sampling. This technique adequately desorbs the explosives however when multiple explosives are present in the sorbed sample they are introduced into the IMS at the same time as a single sample plug with no real time separation between them. By stepping the temperature of the preconcentrator up as a function of time from below the boiling point of the most volatile of the analytes to above the boiling point of the least volatile analyte the desorbed analytes can be separated as a function of time. Therefore the use of a preconcentrator with temperature stepping enables real time separation of analytes in a multicomponent mixture. The spectrum of ion arrival times at the ion collector is then a function of the desorption component of separation from the preconcentrator i.e. real time separation and the relative ion mobility of each ion through the drift region i.e. drift time separation .

As shown in temperature stepped desorption TSD is a technique that pulses the preconcentrator with increasing heating steps. The four heating steps shown in this example raise the temperature starting at 100 C. and reach a final temperature of 220 C. Explosives with higher vapor pressures tend to desorb at the lower temperatures and explosives with lower vapor pressures often desorb at the higher temperatures. This technique is helpful for several reasons. TSD reduces the packet size of explosives entering the IMS at one time which helps conserve the amount of reactant ion available to assist in the ionization process of the explosives and avoids saturating the detector and separates the analytes in real time by heat of vaporization.

Separation in a real time domain can be manipulated using TSD. With single thermal pulses there is little separation in the real time domain. However if multiple thermal pulses exist materials can be selectively desorbed into the IMS at varying temperatures providing separation in the real time domain. Therefore TSD provides an additional dimension to differentiate between compounds when multiple component mixtures are present.

TSD is especially favorable to materials such as explosives that are thermally labile. Thermally labile compounds such as pentaerythritol tetranitrate PETN will decompose at a high temperature between 180 C. and 200 C. TSD provides these explosives with the opportunity to desorb before the temperature reaches its decomposition point. Reduced decomposition will result in more effective detection and possibly improve the quantification ability of IMS for thermally labile compounds. Also some explosives such as octahydro 1 3 5 7 tetranitro 1 3 5 7 tetrazocane also known as HMX do not thermally desorb from the preconcentrator until the temperature exceeds 200 C. With TSD it is possible to detect mixtures containing PETN and HMX without significantly decomposing explosives such as PETN. In the past this was not possible with a single high temperature pulse.

A P clet number in one dimension is defined to first order by the following equation for a plug flow experiment in a pipe.

By isolating an individual signal peak as illustrated by the various windows in the zero moment of the peak can be calculated from Eq. 2 .

The moment analysis can be done in each individual data window by calculating the zero moment of the peak according to Eq. 2 . Here the units are volts sec representing the concentration multiplied by the time variables see L. Leithold 4ed pp. 595 609 1981 . The centroid of the peak in two dimensions can then be calculated according to Eq. 3 . This is mathematically equivalent to determining the point of balance of a peak or first moment in the contour map analogy for each of the dimensions where and are the first moments represented as time domains for the peak. Next the peak width can be determined by calculating the second moment in both dimensions according to Eq. 4 . This is equivalent to determining the standard deviation of the peak see L. C. Andrews and R. L. Phillips pp. 650 651 2003 .

If the location of the peak is defined as a vector where right arrow over t is the centroid of the peak in time space where is the average drift time and is the average real time of the first moments in both dimensions and right arrow over where and are the standard deviation second moment for both real time and drift time domains the symbols and denote unit vectors in the x and y dimension respectively then an ellipse at the 1 e point of the two dimensional peak can be fitted. is a plot illustrating the relationships of the two dimensional first moment centroid and second moment standard deviation for an IMS peak drawn as a contour plot. The centroid of the peak is located at the coordinate t t and has a standard deviation in its x position of and its y position of .

The P clet number for the individual peak is calculated by geometrically adding the ratio of the variance to the mean assuming uncorrelated spreading to get the total standard deviation 

In an ideal system the P clet number is a measure of the ratio of the rate of analyte transport divided by the rate of spreading see H. Scott Fogler 2nd edition p. 767 1992 . In practice a planar preconcentrator or any practical preconcentrator separator has a peak width determined not only by diffusion of the analyte following desorption but also by desorption heating rate distribution of desorption energy from binding sites on the absorbent bed temperature gradients across the absorber and other factors. This is represented by the value of . The width of the detected peak in IMS is a function of several distinct phenomena that are time dependent. Namely these are the initial pulse width diffusion dependent on gas temperature and transit time electrostatic space charge effects capacitive coupling between approaching ions and the collector electric field gradients temperature gradients gate depletion dynamic leakage pressure fluctuations and ion molecule reactions in the drift space see J. Xu et al. 72 23 5787 2000 K. B. Pfeifer and R. C. Sanchez 5 3 63 2002 and K. B. Pfeifer and A. N. Rumpf 77 16 5215 2005 .

The calculated moments and P clet values provide a quantitative comparison of system performance under different sets of operating conditions but cannot be interpreted as due only to contributions of convective and diffusive transport.

A series of experiments were conducted to optimize the separation and detection of RDX and 2 methyl 1 3 5 trinitrobenzene TNT explosives using an IMS coupled with a preconcentrator operating in the TSD mode. A total of 1028 different runs with 21 distinct concentration profiles and 48 distinct temperature profiles provided over 8000 separate signal peaks. The system consisted of a preconcentrator comprising a stainless steel felt that could be electrically heated coupled to a PCP IMS operating as a detector. In actual application large volumes of room air that potentially contain particles of explosives are drawn through the felt and then desorbed by heating into the IMS input. In this experiment in order to maintain consistency dissolved samples of explosives were deposited using a micro liter syringe onto the center of the felt and then heated to desorb them. After the limiting ranges were chosen a Hardin Sloane I optimal design was used to determine sets of values of the operating parameters for which experimental measurements were made see R. H. Hardin and N. J. A. Sloane 37 3 339 1993 . The run order for the parameter sets was randomized to minimize systematic bias due to unknown factors.

A subset of the data is shown in which illustrates the application of the P clet technique. This plot shows a subset of recipe number i.e. run number vs. P clet number illustrating the optimization of the time delay and temperature steps for measuring TNT using the preconcentrator and IMS. The P clet number for experiment number for TNT is much larger for window than for windows . In addition other tests with different delay times and temperature steps do not produce the high P clet number. Thus the recipe represented by run is optimized to produce a high fidelity TNT peak for this IMS measurement system. By employing this two dimensional P clet method the peaks can be automatically scored and the operational parameters of the IMS system can thus be optimized.

The present invention has been described as a method of multi dimensional moment analysis for the characterization of signal peaks. It will be understood that the above description is merely illustrative of the applications of the principles of the present invention the scope of which is to be determined by the claims viewed in light of the specification. Other variants and modifications of the invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art.
