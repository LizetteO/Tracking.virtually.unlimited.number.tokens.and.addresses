title: Interleaved single magnetic resonance sequence for MR quantification
abstract: A magnetic resonance sequence includes an interleaved slice-selective pre-pulse and a slice-selective multi-echo acquisition. This sequence is repeated with different delays between the pre-pulse and the acquisition resulting in a matrix of complex images. Based on this matrix T1 and T2 relaxations, proton density and the B1 field can be estimated. These quantified parameters enable synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and form a robust input for tissue segmentation in computer aided diagnosis for MRI.

The present invention relates to a method system and computer program product for generating a MR imaging sequence. The sequence can advantageously be used for retrieving the physical parameters T1 and T2 relaxation proton density PD and the radio frequent B1 field from a magnetic resonance MR sequence.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI can generate cross sectional images in any plane including oblique planes . Medical MRI most frequently relies on the relaxation properties of excited hydrogen nuclei in water and fat. When the object to be imaged is placed in a powerful uniform magnetic field the spins of the atomic nuclei with non integer spin numbers within the tissue all align either parallel to the magnetic field or anti parallel. The output result of an MRI scan is an MRI contrast image or a series of MRI contrast images.

In order to understand MRI contrast it is important to have some understanding of the time constants involved in relaxation processes that establish equilibrium following RF excitation. As the high energy nuclei relax and realign they emit energy at rates which are recorded to provide information about their environment. The realignment of nuclear spins with the magnetic field is termed longitudinal relaxation and the time typically about 1 sec required for a certain percentage of the tissue nuclei to realign is termed Time 1 or T1. T2 weighted imaging relies upon local dephasing of spins following the application of the transverse energy pulse the transverse relaxation time typically 

Image contrast is then created by using a selection of image acquisition parameters that weights signal by T1 T2 or no relaxation time PD proton density images . Both T1 weighted and T2 weighted images as well as PD images are acquired for most medical examinations. The RF excitation of the MR scanner is performed by a rotating B1 field inside an RF transmission coil. This coil is designed to generate a homogeneous B1 field such that the RF excitation is identical throughout the imaged object. In practice imperfection of the coil design and the presence of the imaged object itself may distort the B1 field such that the RF excitation and with that the flip angle may deviate from the intended value. This has an unanticipated effect on image contrast.

In conventional contrast imaging the absolute signal intensity observed in the images has no direct meaning it is rather the intensity difference the contrast between different tissues that lead to a diagnosis. A more quantitative approach can be applied based on the measured physical parameters T1 T2 and PD the B1 field is merely used to correct for scanner imperfections . Using T1 T2 and PD MR images can be synthesized that are very similar to conventional MR images but with a free choice of scanner setting TE TR and pre pulses. Moreover T1 T2 and PD form a robust input for tissue segmentation and classification which could lead to MR computer aided diagnose.

It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method and device for determining the physical parameters T1 T2 and PD.

This object and others are obtained by the method and device as set out in the appended claims. Hence a sequence that can measure all four parameters T1 T2 PD and B1 in one single sequence is provided. The advantage of a single sequence is that the MR scanner remains in an identical state avoiding image intensity corrections and the risk for patient movement is reduced avoiding the need for image registration. Also the time required for using the MR scanner can be reduced.

In accordance with one embodiment a method of processing a set of a number of x magnetic resonance MR slices includes in a first phase or processing stage using a slice selective pre pulse to saturate or invert a spin magnetization of a first slice n and in a second phase or processing stage using a slice selective multi echo acquisition of a second slice m. The first and second phases or processing stages are interleaved in a sequence and n and m are integers in a range 1 . . . x.

In accordance with one embodiment the sequence is repeated a number of times where the delay between the pre pulse and the acquisition on each particular slice is varied.

In accordance with one embodiment the MR sequence is generated where the pre pulse has a flip angle in the range 90 180 degrees 90 degrees corresponds to a saturation pre pulse and 180 degrees corresponds to an inversion pre pulse.

In accordance with one embodiment the acquisition corresponds to a multi echo spin echo acquisition including refocusing pulses between the echo read outs.

In accordance with one embodiment the acquisition corresponds to a multi echo gradient echo acquisition without refocusing pulses between the echo read outs.

In accordance with one embodiment each echo read out generates multiple k space lines for k space using the Echo Planar Imaging EPI technique.

In accordance with one embodiment the method further comprises generating a matrix of images with size a b with a variation of a echo times and a variation of b delay times after the pre pulse. In particular an increasing image intensity of the matrix of images as a function of delay time after the pre pulse can be used to determine the T1 relaxation for each image pixel of the imaged object and or a decreasing image intensity of the matrix of images as a function of echo time can be used to determine the T2 relaxation for each image pixel of the imaged object.

In accordance with one embodiment the ratio between the lowest and highest image intensity as a function of delay time after the pre pulse is used to estimate the B1 field for each image pixel of the imaged object.

In accordance with one embodiment the proton density for each image pixel of the imaged object is estimated by correcting the image intensity for the T1 T2 and B1 effects.

The invention also extends to a MRI system adapted to generate images using a sequence generated by the method and to a computer program used to generate the sequence.

In a general view of a setup of a MRI system is depicted. The system comprises a MR scanner . The MR scanner is operative to generate MRI data by means of scanning a living object. The MR scanner is further connected to a computer for processing data generated by the scanner . The computer receives input commands from one or several input devices generally represented by an input device . The input device may be one or many of a computer mouse a keyboard a track ball or any other input device. The computer is further connected to a screen for visualizing the processed scanner data as a contrast image.

A basic block of the quantification sequence is shown in with two phases in each block repeated each repetition time Tover the complete measurement. In the measurement Gm phase encoding Gp and slice selection Gs gradients and the RF pulse amplitude are shown over time. There are two phases in each block. In Phase Saturation the pre pulse with flip angle and subsequent spoiling acts on a slice m. In Phase Acquisition the multi echo acquisition is performed of slice n. In this particular embodiment multiple 180 refocusing pulses are applied for spin echo acquisition rather than gradient acquisition no refocusing pulses as well as the acquisition is accelerated with an Echo Planar Imaging factor 3 read out scheme.

In the first phase a slice selective pre pulse acts on a slice n followed by spoiling of the signal Saturation . The flip angle of this pre pulse is in the range 90 180 degrees where the specific cases of 90 degrees correspond to a saturation pre pulse and 180 degrees to an inversion pre pulse. In the second phase a slice selective acquisition of another slice m Acquisition consisting of multiple echoes is performed. Optionally the acquisition can be accelerated through an Echo Planar Imaging EPI technique that acquires several k space lines per echo. By shifting the order of the slices n and m with respect to each other the desired delay time between the saturation and the acquisition phase of a particular slice can be set.

The result of this sequence is a matrix of complex images a b with a different echo times and b different delay time after the pre pulse. The increase of signal intensity as a function of delay time is a measure for T1 relaxation. Typically a mono exponentional increase is assumed. The decrease of signal intensity as a function of echo time is a measure for T2 relaxation. Here typically a mono exponentional decrease is assumed. The B1 field can be retrieved from the signal increase as a function of delay time described by the T1 relaxation by taking the ratio between the lowest signal intensity Mat delay 0 just after the pre pulse and the highest signal intensity Mat delay T just before the subsequent saturation pulse in the sequence where B1 is found according to B1 a cos M M since the difference between Mand Mis entirely due to the effect of the pre pulse and subsequent spoiling. Finally PD can be calculated by extrapolating the measured image intensity to echo time zero and repetition time infinite.

For ease of calculation the matrix might be reduced by retrieving T1 and B1 from the weighted sum of all images with identical delay times after the pre pulse matrix 1 b and T2 from the weighted sum of all images with identical echo times matrix a 1 .

Additional aspects are described below which is the text of Warntjes et al. Rapid Magnetic Resonance Quantification on the Brain Optimization for Clinical Usage vol. 60 pp. 320 329 Jul. 28 2008 .

A method is presented for rapid simultaneous quantification of the longitudinal Trelaxation the transverse Trelaxation the proton density PD and the amplitude of the local Radio Frequency Bfield. All four parameters are measured in one single scan by means of a multi slice multi echo and multi delay acquisition. It is based on a previously reported method which was substantially improved for routine clinical usage. The improvements comprise of the use of a multi slice spin echo technique a background phase correction and a spin system simulation to compensate for the slice selective RF pulse profile effects. The aim of the optimization was to achieve the optimal result for the quantification of Magnetic Resonance parameters within a clinically acceptable time. One benchmark was high resolution coverage of the brain within 5 minutes. In this scan time the measured inter subject standard deviation in a group of volunteers was 2 8 depending on the tissue voxel size 0.8 0.8 5 mm . As an example the method was applied to a patient with Multiple Sclerosis where the diseased tissue could clearly be distinguished from healthy reference values. Additionally it was shown that using the approach of Synthetic MRI both accurate conventional contrast images as well as quantification maps can be generated based on the same scan.

Tissues in the human body can be distinguished with Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI depending on their MR parameters such as the longitudinal Trelaxation the transverse Trelaxation and the proton density PD. In clinical routine the MR scanner settings such as echo time T repetition time Tand flip angle are most often chosen to highlight or saturate the image intensity of tissues resulting in a T weighting or a T weighting in a contrast image. These procedures are well established and relatively quick. A major disadvantage of using such contrast images is that the absolute intensity has no direct meaning and diagnosis relies on comparison with surrounding tissues in the image. In many cases it is therefore necessary to perform several different contrast scans. A more direct approach is the absolute quantification of the tissue parameters T Tand PD. In this case pathology can be examined on a pixel basis to establish the absolute deviation compared to the normal values. Automatic segmentation of such tissue images would be straightforward and the progress of the disease can then be expressed in absolute numbers. An excellent overview of the use of absolute quantification on neurodegenerative diseases is provided in Ref. 1.

Although the advantages of absolute quantification are obvious its clinical use is still limited. At least two major hurdles need to be addressed to stimulate a wide spread clinical usage. For many methods the excessive scan time associated with the measurement of the three parameters has so far prohibited its clinical application. However in recent years there has been substantial progress see e.g. Refs 2 14 and the method here presented allows for absolute quantification of T T PD and the Binhomogeneity of a whole volume with high resolution in a mere 5 minutes. The second hurdle which must not be underestimated is the clinical evaluation of the images. So far there is only limited experience in using absolute T Tand PD maps in clinical routines and most radiologists will want to confirm their findings using conventionally weighted contrast images. The quantification scan might then be considered as superfluous in the limited time available for an examination. This item is addressed using the approach of Synthetic MRI 15 20 . It is possible to synthesize any Tweighted or Tweighted contrast image based on the absolute parameters by calculating the expected image intensity as a function of a virtual set of scanner settings. Synthetic MRI can be seen as a translation of the absolute maps into conventional contrast images thus a single quantification scan can provide both the absolute maps and the contrast images for the examination.

A recently published manuscript explained a method that enabled rapid simultaneous quantification of T T PD and Bfield called QRAPTEST 2 . The current work presents a substantially improved method that has been optimized to accommodate clinical use dubbed Quantification of Relaxation times And Proton density by Multi echo Acquisition of a Saturation recovery using TSE Read out QRAPMASTER . Two main issues of the QRAPTEST method were addressed. Firstly a spin echo sequence is used rather than a gradient echo sequence. In routine clinical practice spin echo sequences are most commonly used owing to their insensitivity to susceptibility effects. These are caused by Binhomogeneities in the volume of interest leading to a T relaxation in gradient echo imaging where T is shorter than T. This may result in image blurring of the tissue interfaces at longer echo times. Secondly the maximum excitation flip angle for the QRAPTEST acquisition was typically limited to 4 8 degrees due to its role as a correction factor in the calculation of Trelaxation. The QRAPMASTER approach uses a multi slice sequence with a long repetition time between subsequent acquisitions removing the limitation of the flip angle. The presented method is very signal efficient and accurate values of the absolute MR parameters with a large dynamic range over a complete volume can be obtained within the desired 5 minute benchmark.

A basic block of the quantification sequence is shown in with two phases in each block repeated over the complete measurement. In the first phase a slice selective saturation pulse acts on a slice n followed by spoiling of the signal Saturation . In the second phase a slice selective spin echo acquisition of another slice m Acquisition consisting of multiple echoes that are acquired to measure the transverse relaxation time T is performed. The acquisition can be accelerated through an Echo Planar Imaging EPI technique that acquires several k space lines per spin echo Gradient Spin Echo or GRaSE . The advantage of this technique is to simultaneously reduce the Specific Absorption Rate SAR of the measurement making it attractive for high field applications. The number of echoes and the echo spacing can be freely chosen to accommodate any dynamic range for the measurement of T.

By shifting the order of the slices n and m with respect to each other the desired delay time between saturation and acquisition of a particular slice can be set. By using different delay times the longitudinal relaxation time Tafter a saturation pulse is retrieved from multiple scans. Since the number of scans and the delay times can be freely chosen the dynamic range of Tcan also be set as desired. The freedom to choose the number of data points on the Tcurve is an important difference compared to previously described multi slice methods where the number of data points are determined by the number of slices e.g. 8 9 . An important feature of the QRAPMASTER approach is that Tand Tmaps are measured independently of each other and hence no error propagation can occur between the two. The sequence is very signal effective the duty cycle of the receivers is approximately 50 60 of the total scan time and there is no limit on the acquisition flip angle. By using a saturation pulse rather than a more common inversion pulse another very significant advantage is the possibility to simultaneously measure the local Bfield as will be explained later. Based on T Tand Bit is possible to retrieve the unsaturated magnetization M which can be scaled to the proton density PD. The sequence results in black blood imaging due to the constant saturation of flowing blood. A Regional Saturation REST pulse was added located parallel to the imaging volume to avoid a difference in behavior of the first and last slices.

To correct for the non ideal behavior of the slice selective RF pulses on the quantification results as well as to relate the observed saturation flip angle to the effective excitation flip angle a spin system simulation of the complete sequence was performed. RF pulse simulations are excellently described in Ref. 21 where a geometrical system of magnetic spins was defined with the macroscopic longitudinal magnetization M 1 and the transverse magnetization M 0. The amplitude envelopes of the 120 saturation 90 excitation and 180 refocusing pulses of the quantification measurement were obtained from the MR scanner software.

The envelopes were approximated as a set of RF block pulses of 1 s unit time. The effect of the separate RF block pulses on the spin system was sandwiched with the effect of the simultaneously applied gradient field during a unit time. The complete quantification scan was simulated for each individual magnetic spin. The 120 saturation pulse was applied rotating the spins around the y axis and the resulting transverse magnetization Mwas spoiled with a strong z gradient. After a delay of between 0 and 4000 ms a spin echo acquisition was performed during which a Trelaxation of the magnetization was allowed using T 1000 ms. The spin echo acquisition consisted of the 90 excitation pulse rotating the spins around the y axis and a series of 180 refocusing pulses rotating the spins around the x axis together with gradient winders and rewinders. The macroscopic signal intensity was obtained as the integral of the x component of the transverse magnetization Mof the spins.

The complete quantification measurement consists of numerous scans with different delay times T providing a Trelaxation curve after the saturation pulse. The steady state magnetization Mat a specific delay time Tcan be found using the recursive relation of magnetization over the repetition time T using an excitation pulse and the steady state magnetization Mat the end of T just before the subsequent saturation pulse cos exp 1 cos exp 2 where Mis the unsaturated magnetization. Substituting Eq. 2 into Eq. 1 the magnetization Mas a function of delay time Tafter the saturation pulse becomes 

Hence from the measured intensity at various delay times a fit can be performed to retrieve both Tand M. Furthermore from the same Trelaxation curve the effective local saturation flip angle can be found and thus the local Bfield. This is done using the ratio between the magnetization Mat time just after the saturation pulse and Mat time T just before the subsequent saturation pulse cos 4 since the difference between Mand Mis entirely due to the effect of the saturation pulse and subsequent spoiling. Based on the observed the actual local excitation flip angle can be estimated as well though this is not as straightforward because it requires knowledge of the RF pulse profiles and the actual spin behavior in a particular Bfield. A simulation was performed to relate to see below .

As previously mentioned each acquisition is performed using a multi echo read out that enables the simultaneous measurement of Trelaxation. Using Tand the fitted Mfrom the Tcurve the intensity S proportional to Mat an echo time zero can be retrieved. Proton density is then calculated from S including a number of scaling factors according to 

The fitting routine was performed as follows. The phase of the last dynamic echo images was used as a reference phase. For all other images this phase is subtracted to generate real images instead of modulus identical to the phase sensitive method 22 . This removes the ambiguity of the signal sign that occurs in modulus images. The noise behavior of the resulting images is Gaussian rather than Rician removing the potential overestimation of signal intensity at low signal strength.

A mono exponential Trelaxation was retrieved from all images where the absolute intensity served as a weight in the least square fit. The expected intensity at an echo time of zero was subsequently calculated for all time points. Using this procedure all echo images are projected onto a single Tcurve at echo time zero. The saturation flip angle was calculated according to Eq. 4 from this curve. Since the Bfield was assumed to not change rapidly over the volume a median filter of 10 mm was applied. A least square fit on the Tcurve results in an estimate of Tand M. In this fit M Mcos was taken as an additional condition. Finally Mwas scaled to proton density.

Using the approach of Synthetic MRI it is possible to create contrast weighted images based on the quantified data using the well known equations that describe MR intensity as a function of scanner settings such as echo time T repetition time Tand flip angle in relation to T Tand PD 21 .

Since T T and Tare independent parameters any contrast image can be synthesized. The fitting and visualization of the quantification data as well as the calculation and the visualization of the synthesized MR images were done using an in house developed software program based on IDL Research Systems Inc Boulder Colo. . Fitting a full data set requires in the order of 20 seconds on a Pentium III computer.

All experiments were performed on a 1.5T Achieva scanner Philips Medical Systems Best The Netherlands . The longitudinal magnetization after a saturation an excitation and a refocusing pulse and thus their effective flip angles as a function of slice distance were determined by applying either of these pulses followed immediately by gradient spoiling and acquisition perpendicular to the slice. This was done using an agar phantom with Trelaxation of 380 ms previously determined with a repetition time of 3 s. The observed intensity was corrected for the 10 ms delay between the center of the RF pulses and the start of the actual acquisition. The intensity was normalized by repeating the measurement where the RF amplitude is set to zero. For the clinical scan 5 spin echoes were acquired using an EPI factor of 3 at multiples of 20 ms echo time. The resulting acquisition time per sequence block was 130 ms. The repetition time Twas set to minimum which for the 20 slices was 2600 ms. A total of 4 dynamic scans were performed with delay times between the saturation pulse and acquisition of 130 390 1170 and 2470 ms. The matrix size was 270over a Field of View of 215 mm leading to an in plane resolution of 0.8 mm reconstructed to 0.75 mm. Further acceleration was achieved using a SENSE factor of 2 leading to a scan time of 5 14 minutes. To ensure steady state conditions a single dummy acquisition was performed across all slices prior to each dynamic and the delay times were performed in reversed order. In addition an 80 mm REST slab was located at the neck of the patient to suppress blood flow artifacts. To avoid potential errors in the measured Tcurves due to slice cross talk the slice order of the quantification scan was chosen linearly such that the error would become similar for each slice. In our view this is a better approach than a standard interleaved slice order that could lead to a varying error of the Tcurves per slice.

The QRAPMASTER sequence was compared to the golden standard methods for quantification. The Trelaxation was measured using the standard inversion recovery sequence a single slice spin echo with TR 10 s and inversion delay times of 100 400 700 1500 and 5000 ms. The Trelaxation was measured using a 3D multi echo sequence with 15 spin echoes at intervals of 15 ms and TR 3 s. The Bfield was retrieved using a flip angle sweep of a 3D gradient echo sequence with TR 8 s and flip angles at 30 50 70 90 and 120 degrees. A sinus was fitted to the resulting intensity to retrieve the Bvalues.

To examine a patient with Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis CDMS TW images T 590 ms T 15 ms resolution 0.8 mm and the QRAPMASTER quantification scan were acquired. Gadolinium contrast agent was administered Magnevist Schering Germany followed by the acquisition of TW images T 4400 ms T 100 ms resolution 0.6 mm and TW FLAIR images T 6000 ms T 120 ms inversion delay 2000 ms resolution 0.8 mm . Finally a second acquisition of the TW images and the quantification scan was performed. For comparison 10 healthy volunteers were investigated with the QRAPMASTER scan using a lower SENSE acceleration factor which led to scan time of 8 35 minutes. All in vivo studies were performed in compliance with the regulations of Swedish law.

The 90 excitation 120 saturation and 180 refocusing pulse were measured as described in the Methods section. The effective RF pulse flip angle in is displayed as a function of distance across the slice normalized to slice thickness where 100 data points were measured per unit. The solid lines represent the simulation of the pulse angles based on their amplitude envelope over time and their associated gradients. To aid visual inspection the ideal slice selective 90 120 and 180 RF pulse angles are shown as dashed lines. As can be seen in the ideal flip angle was only achieved at exactly the resonance in the center of the slice. Generally all other frequencies have lower effective flip angles. Furthermore there was a slight non zero flip angle outside the intended slice thickness. The simulations of the RF pulses agree very well with the measured data with only the central peak of the refocusing pulse not entirely resolved in the measurement.

The quantification sequence was simulated for each point in using the actual non ideal RF pulse profiles. The x component of the transverse magnetization Mwas integrated over the complete slice distance of to reflect the signal intensity of the measurement. If ideal slice selective RF pulses were used the observed normalized intensity as a function of delay time would correspond to the dotted line in . The line starts at cos 120 0.5 and approaches unity at infinite times after the saturation pulse. However the intensity of all spin echo read outs begins at 0.26 when using the non ideal pulse profiles. A long delay after the saturation pulse the first spin echo read out intensity approaches 0.899 the second spin echo read out approaches 0.954 and all subsequent spin echo read outs approach a value close to the average intensity of 0.932.

The simulation showed that the signal obtained from the measurement reflects the actual Tdecay but will appear to be associated with both a lower effective saturation angle and a lower effective excitation angle than the intended nominal values. Using Eq. 4 the effective saturation pulse angle of the intensity curve of was calculated to be 106 cos 0.26 0.932 rather than the nominal 120 . From the first 10 spin echo read outs the effective excitation pulse angle where M Msin of the first read out corresponds to 64.0 the second read out to 72.6 and the average read out to 68.7 rather than the nominal 90 .

The simulation was repeated for a number of different Bfield strengths. The Bfield varies across a patient and the intended saturation and excitation pulse amplitudes thus vary accordingly. In the observed effective saturation pulse angle is shown as a function of the nominal saturation pulse angle. In the observed effective excitation pulse angle is shown as a function of the nominal excitation pulse angle. The dashed lines indicate the intended Bfield.

The RF pulse simulations were also used to investigate the potential problem of cross talk between slices leading to a through plane smoothing of the input data for the quantification. The simulation showed that the contribution of the signal outside a slice was about 7 of the total signal. Introducing a gap of 10 of the slice thickness between the slices reduced the amount to 3 .

Based on the simulation results two modifications were incorporated into the fitting algorithm. Firstly the measured intensities of each first and second echo were corrected. The intensity of the first echo was multiplied by a factor 1.036 and the intensity of the second echo was multiplied by a factor 0.977 such that the effective excitation angle became 68.7 for all spin echo read outs at nominal Bfield. This correction significantly improved Testimation since the method only uses a relatively low number of spin echo read outs.

Secondly the measured effective saturation pulse angle was related to the effective excitation pulse by combining and into where the effective excitation pulse angle was plotted as a function of effective saturation pulse angle . With this diagram the observed saturation angle from the measurement can be converted into the effective excitation angle that was used to calculate the proton density Eq. 5 . As seen from the relation between the pulse angles can be approximated by a simple 34.5 

Absolute quantification of T Tand PD was performed on 10 healthy volunteers Mean age 29 years 8 male 2 female . Table 1 summarizes the normal values for various anatomies of the brain. These values correspond well with those from the literature. Note that the average values of white matter vary smoothly across the brain Tis shorter in the frontal part of the brain than in the occipital part and Tis slightly higher in the center of the brain. The thalamus showed different values across the tissue and the values of its center were chosen for the Table. Most voxels containing cortical grey matter are affected by partial volume effects with nearby cerebro spinal fluid CSF or white matter and the intrinsic absolute values are difficult to retrieve. The proton density of CSF appears somewhat high possibly due to flow effects or diffusion. In spite of these notions the average values fall within a relatively narrow range.

For validation the clinical QRAPMASTER sequence results of a single slice of the brain from a healthy volunteer were compared to the golden standard methods for T Tand B. Combining these three methods also retrieved the PD. displays the Trelaxation measured by QRAPMASTER and displays the relaxation measured by the reference standard inversion recovery. The scaling is 0 2000 ms. There is clearly a significant blurring in caused by movement of the volunteer over the total acquisition time of 19 minutes of the inversion recovery images. The cortex appears thicker and the ventricles show an edge artifact. Regions Of Interest ROI were placed at various locations. The measured values of all pixels within the ROI s of the reference Tmeasurement were plotted in as a function of the measured values using QRAPMASTER. The scale for the relaxation times is logarithmic. Most regions are in excellent agreement. For CSF there is a significant spread of measured values. This is caused by partial volume effects at the tissue interface of CSF with white matter where values are sensitive to the slightest sub pixel size misregistration between the two sequences. To avoid this effect most ROI s were placed in more or less homogeneous regions. The mean difference for the ROI s excluding CSF was 6.2 .

Similarly the results of the same QRAPMASTER measurements were compared to the multi echo sequence scan time 5 minutes in . The scaling is 0 200 ms. The Tvalues obtained by both methods were very similar with a mean difference of 5.2 excluding CSF mainly caused by the difference in the values of subcutaneous fat 42 ms using QRAPMASTER versus 51 ms for the reference method . A comparison with the flip angle sweep method is shown in . Both images were median smoothed over 10 mm. Still movement artifacts in the 13 minute scan time and insufficient magnetization recovery in the 8 s repetition time led to incorrect values for CSF using the flip angle sweep method as seen from the large cloud of data points to the right side of the plot in . It is also clear that the standard deviation of the values from the reference method is much larger than those of the QRAPMASTER method despite a longer scan time.

All reference methods were combined to calculate the proton density of the axial slice. The comparison is displayed in . The scaling is 500 1000 for PD where 1000 corresponds to pure water at 37 C. All errors in the previous parameters propagate to PD and the combined reference methods with a total scan time of 37 minutes result in only a moderately accurate image . The mean difference of the values in is 12.1 .

The quantification method was applied to a patient with Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis both before and after the administration of Gadolinium contrast media. The post Gd absolute MR tissue parameters T T Band PD of a transversal slice of the patient s brain are shown in and are similar to and . The administration of Gadolinium did not result in significant differences in relaxation times indicating the absence of a blood brain barrier leakage. The cortical tissue of the patient had an average Trelaxation of 1022 45 ms before and 998 47 ms after Gd and a Trelaxation of 87 4 ms both before and after Gd. The proton density was 880 35. For frontal white matter these values were T 598 34 and T 70 4 before Gd T 578 36 and T 68 5 after Gd and the proton density PD 670 21.

To visualize the quantification results for the Thyper enhancement of the patient the three measured parameters were used as coordinates in a Carthesian R R PD space where the longitudinal relaxation rate R 1 Tand the transverse relaxation rate R 1 T. All tissues then group into characteristic clusters. Voxels containing a mixture of two different kinds of tissues appear on a straight line between both clusters. The position on this line is a weighted average of the partial volume of the corresponding tissue types. a scatter plot of such a visualization from a small portion of the brain from a healthy volunteer indicated by the ROI in the Tweighted image inset . Only the projection of R R PD space onto the R Rplane is shown. The tissue clusters of white matter WM cortex and CSF are clearly observed as well as the voxels containing both tissue types. The amount of CSF in the gyri inside the ROI is so small that there are no voxels present consisting entirely of CSF. The reference positions of the separate clusters were obtained from Table 1 and are highlighted by the grey circles in . The patient with Multiple Sclerosis is similarly visualized in . It can be observed from the data points that MS lesions have distinctively different values than normal tissue on this R Rplot. Lesions even seem to have two distinct phases as indicated by the two grey lines over the data points. In the first phase there is a differentiation from normal white matter with a significant reduction in R from WM R 1.75 sand R 13.3 stowards R 1.54 sand R 10.5 s T 650 ms and T 95 ms indicated by the first grey dot. Simultaneously the water content increases slightly from 650 to 680. This affected area covers about one quarter of the ROI around the hyper intense spot in the T weighted image. Although these changes are significant they only show up as faint white areas in the TW and TW FLAIR images and might not be considered for diagnosis. The actual hyper enhanced spots on the contrast images consist of a dramatic increase in all three parameters representing the second phase in the lesion data of . The water content has increased to 1000 at R 0.61 sand R 5.88 s T 1650 ms and T 170 ms indicated by the second grey dot. At this position the destruction of white matter appears to be complete and is replaced by liquid. The relaxation rates of a lesion might even be lower though this appears more to reflect the composition of the lesional liquid. The development of MS lesions over these two phases is in line with the observation of enhanced intensity in a FLAIR image at an early stage and a darker appearance at a later stage of the lesioning process.

As shown in the results absolute values for the longitudinal Trelaxation the transverse Trelaxation the proton density PD and the local Radio Frequency Bfield can be determined within a clinically acceptable time of 5 minutes covering the complete brain with high resolution. A significant strength of the presented QRAPMASTER method is that it not only measures all relevant MR parameters simultaneously such that the acquired signal is utilized for an accurate estimation of the complete set of parameters it also includes considered especially important an intrinsic correction for Binhomogeneity. The RF pulse simulation helped the understanding of signal behavior using non ideal slice selective RF pulses and also improved the fitting algorithm. Reproducible results measured in a group of volunteers agreed well with literature values. The comparison with reference methods showed good correspondence of the obtained values. However a rapid method is clearly essential for quantification since the long scan time of all reference methods combined unavoidably leads to misregistration and thus inaccurate results especially for PD.

Care should be taken in the interpretation of the absolute MR parameters. In our approach using only a low number of relaxation data points we assume a mono exponential decay for the relaxation times. For many tissues Tand Trelaxation might be multi exponential 10 11 which reflects an underlying partition of the water in various microscopic environments and is often considered for date analysis using stretched exponentials. Furthermore note that the brain anatomies are far more complex and differentiated than what appears from Table 1. The standard deviation of the values within a single volunteer is larger than the standard deviation within the whole group suggesting that part of the variance in the absolute values is owing to intrinsic tissue inhomogeneity rather than to noise. For clinical use however it is important to find a consistent change of tissue parameters as compared to normal values. From Table 1 it is clear that healthy tissue has a narrow range of values that can be taken as a reference value to distinguish pathology.

An example of clinical absolute quantification is shown on a patient afflicted by Multiple Sclerosis. The lesions inside the white matter clearly show up as a simultaneous increase of T Tand PD. Using conventional imaging only the most pronounced affected areas can be distinguished and various ways of relating area size to the clinical symptoms of the disease have been proposed e.g. 23 25 . Based on contrast images alone with significant variation between MR scanners related to scanner parameters and particular software versions it is very difficult to automatically segment the plaques reliably 26 27 . Using absolute quantification however the scanner dependency is in principle removed and the deviation from normal white matter and the absolute progress of the lesions can be accurately visualized as shown in .

It is important to note that the signal of flowing blood is suppressed in the QRAPMASTER sequence. This might explain the nearly equal relaxation values of the MS patient before and after Gd injection since the blood component of the effective relaxation per voxel is not visible.

An actual blood brain barrier leakage however would show up since the infiltrated brain tissue is static. Using the relaxation parameters partial volume of the tissue can be calculated and a more accurate measure for the stage and total volume of MS lesions could potentially be retrieved with sufficient accuracy for clinical diagnosis. This is a promising result and invites further investigation. Other clinical examples of quantification with important partial volume effects are the estimation of excess water content in case of oedema or the extent of neurosarcoidosis.

A future widespread clinical use of absolute quantification of the MR parameters could be facilitated by the application of Synthetic MRI. shows that the synthetic contrast images based on the absolute parameter maps of reflect tissue contrast very similar to that observed in conventional contrast images. An important difference between conventional and synthetic contrast images is that the latter are based on absolute values. Not only do the images have perfect registration but all scanner dependencies such as T Tor Binhomogeneity are in fact merely artificially added parameters for familiarity. Since Synthetic MRI allows the computation of an infinite number of different contrast weighted images it could be a very useful technique for screening purposes with any relevant combination of the scanner settings T T and Twhere the optimal set of contrast parameter settings is unknown a priori. A radiologist could have the absolute parameter maps next to the apparently normal contrast images based on the same quantification scan. Potentially this combination might replace the acquisition of a whole series of conventional images and perhaps save valuable scanner time.

The presented QRAPMASTER method describes rapid quantification of Tand Trelaxation proton density and Bfield covering the brain at high resolution in a scan time of only 5 minutes. Such an absolute measurement would support diagnosis with quantitative values for the progress of diseases. Validation is done on a group of volunteers and a clinical example of the technique application on a patient with Multiple Sclerosis is shown. Synthetic contrast images are generated from the same quantification data set as a visual aid for the clinical radiologist to verify the results without the need to use a plethora of different acquisition series that consume valuable scanning time. We expect that rapid quantification and subsequent image synthesis will be an important clinical tool in the near future.
