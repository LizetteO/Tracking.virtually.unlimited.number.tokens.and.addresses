The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing 2E 3 4 4 fluorophenyl 6 isopropyl 2 N methyl N methylsulfonylamino pyrimidin 5 yl propenal of formula I 

Rosuvastatin which is an antihypercholesterolemic drug is chemically known as E 7 4 4 fluorophenyl 6 isopropyl 2 methyl methylsulfonyl amino pyrimidin 5 yl 3R 5S 3 5 dihydroxyhept 6 enoic acid calcium 2 1 salt of formula II. Rosuvastatin was for the first time disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 260 440. Rosuvastatin is being marketed under the proprietary name CRESTOR as an oral tablet for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In view of the importance of Rosuvastatin as a lipid lowering agent several synthetic methods have been reported in the literature to prepare rosuvastatin some of which are summarized below 

U.S. Pat. No. 5 260 440 discloses a process for preparing Rosuvastatin in examples. The process is as shown below 

The difficulties in the above process are that the intermediate A is not obtained in pure form and its purification is tedious and overall yield is extremely low. Even when intermediate A is not obtained in pure form further condensation with intermediate 8 to form Rosuvastatin which does not result in Rosuvastatin of right quality as the product contains unacceptable quantity of impurity levels.

WO 2000 049014 A1 describes a novel chemical process for the preparation of ter butyl E 6 2 4 4 fluorophenyl 6 isopropyl 2 methyl methylsulfonyl amino pyrimidin 5 yl vinyl 4R 6S 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxan 4 yl acetate which comprises reacting diphenyl 4 4 fluorophenyl 6 isopropyl 2 methyl methyl sulfonyl amino pyrimidin 5 ylmethylphosphineoxide with tert butyl 2 4R 6S 6 formyl 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxan 4 yl acetate and its further conversion to rosuvastatin.

WO 2003 097614 A2 describes a modified procedure for the preparation of the starting material 4 4 fluorophenyl 6 isopropyl 2 methyl methylsulfonyl amino pyrimidin 5 carboxaldehyde and further conversion to rosuvastatin by condensing with methyl 3R 3 ter butyldimethylsilyl oxy 5 oxo 6 triphenylphosphoranylidene hexanoate. The condensed product was deprotected using methanesulfonic acid and subsequently converted to Rosuvastatin calcium 2 1 salt.

WO 2004 014872 A1 describes a process for the manufacture of Rosuvastatin calcium 2 1 salt which comprises mixing a solution of calcium chloride with a solution of water soluble salt of E 7 4 4 fluorphenyl 6 isopropyl 2 methyl methylsulfonyl amino pyrimidin 5 yl 3R 5S 3 5 dihydroxy hept 6 enoic acid. This process for the preparation of Rosuvastatin employs the use of phosphorane side chain the preparation of side chain requires eight synthetic steps and involves expensive reagents. This process is uneconomical and time consuming hence not appropriate for commercial scale operation.
