This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 540 173 filed Aug. 12 2009 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 088 264 filed Aug. 12 2008.

The invention relates generally to the field of social web sites on global computer networks and in particular to a system and method for managing information personal to individual users of social web sites.

The Internet started as an information source and communication tool and these functions remain important aspects of the Internet. It is also a truism that the Internet is a powerful sales tool. Companies that provide useful internet services have cash flows of more then ten billion dollars a year much of which comes from advertising. The Internet has become the most important medium for distribution of music and is rapidly becoming the most important medium for distribution of videos. The Internet has also become an important vehicle for telecommunications including telephone communication. Because the Internet lends itself to immediate feedback to advertisers and service providers new Internet uses such as directed advertising are rapidly evolving.

The Internet has also grown to become an important social network. From one point of view the Internet is the largest social network on the planet. Moreover on a more explicit level there are scores if not hundreds of social network sites on the Internet and millions of blogs. Social network sites are defined as web sites or applications that provide people with designated relationships to each other access to information that is not available to others who do not have such designated relationships. Because the Internet can be accessed from a myriad of points such as desktop computers connected to wires laptop computers connected to wireless networks hand helds cell phones and integrated products such as Ipods for many individuals the Internet has become their primary means of communication. The explicit social web sites encourage individuals to share their ideas experiences and thoughts with their friends sometimes on an hourly or more frequent basis. These social web sites are uniquely different from conventional informational and shopping web sites in that they provide interactions between the web site users and not just between the web site and individual users. The actions on these web sites are more complex including actions such as adding a contact deleting a contact sending a message to a contact inviting such as to a social event blocking staring which also is called bookmarking or placemarking depending on the web site linking as in assigning an attribute or giving credit set a trust level and voting.

The Internet permits individuals to live in many different social circles that would not be available without the Internet. However it also creates problems in that it is difficult to control identities on the internet. A person may select an identity and find that the identity may be taken by another.

An even greater problem is created by the fact that after an individual or company registers an identity on one site others may intentionally usurp that identity on another site. The proliferation of sites makes it difficult for an individual or company to capture an identity on all sites.

All of the above problems are particularly exacerbated in social network sites. The key purpose of such sites is social networking and if a user s identity is not known or varies such social networking becomes difficult to impossible. Moreover reconnecting among friends on new social network sites is laborious and thus seriously impedes social networking.

For the above and other reasons it would be highly desirable if a method and apparatus were available that allowed an individual corporation or other entity to better control their identities on the internet.

The invention solves the above problems as well as other problems of the prior art by providing a global Internet identity repository and management system. Preferably the internet identity management system permits the user to register an internet identity sometimes referred to herein as username on a plurality of websites. The system of the invention will register the user on three hundred or more websites by filing out information on a single web page. The system also allows the user to easily check to see if their internet identity is already registered on specific web sites.

The invention provides a method of securing an internet identity on a plurality of web sites the method comprising providing a web page permitting an internet user to enter the internet identity to be secured receiving an input indicating that an internet user has entered an identity and requested that the identity be secured on the plurality of web sites registering the internet identity on the plurality of web sites and verifying to the internet user that the identity has been registered on the plurality of web sites. Preferably the providing a web page further comprises providing a web page that permits the user to enter a website URL and the registering further comprises adding the URL to the plurality of websites. Preferably the registering further comprises enter a link back to the URL on the plurality of web sites. Preferably the providing a web page further comprises providing a web page that permits the user to enter a user biography and the registering further comprises adding the biography to the plurality of websites. Preferably the providing a web page comprises providing a web page permitting an internet user to enter variants of the internet identity to be secured. Preferably the providing a web page further comprises providing a web site showing a list of possible web sites on which the internet identity may be secured and the receiving an input comprises receiving a signal that one or more of the possible web sites have been indicated. Preferably the providing a list comprises displaying a plurality of icons each icon representing a different web site on which the internet identity may be secured. Preferably the providing a web page further comprises providing a web page that permits the internet user to select the number of web sites on which the internet identity is to be secured. Preferably the providing a web page further comprises providing a web page permitting the internet user to order the registering on a recurring basis. Preferably the verifying comprises sending an email to an email address. Preferably the providing a web page comprises providing a web page on which the internet user may pay for the securing service. Preferably the providing a web page comprises providing a web page offering a plurality of different payments for the securing services with the number of the web sites on which the internet identity is secured being different for each of the plurality of different payments. Preferably the providing a web page further comprises providing a web page on which the user may attest the user has the right to the internet identity to be secured.

The invention also provides a method for permitting an internet user to discovering web sites on which a user identifier is registered the method comprising using a server computer providing on a client computer remote from the server computer a display of a web page permitting an internet user to enter an identifier the user desires to check for registration on a web site wherein the web site to be checked is not the web site associated with the server computer receiving at the server computer an input indicating the user has entered an identifier to be checked and requesting that the identifier be checked on at least one web site and in response to the input going out to the at least one web site and checking if the identifier is in use on the web site and indicating on the client computer that the identifier is registered on the web site. Preferably the providing a display on the client computer comprises providing a display showing a plurality of icons each icon representing a different web site and the receiving an input comprises receiving a signal that the user has clicked on one of the icons. Preferably the method further comprises recording the web sites on which the identifier is registered.

In a further aspect the invention provides a system for permitting an internet user to discovering web sites on which a user identifier is registered the system comprising a computer readable medium embodying instructions for directing a first processing unit to provide a display of a web page permitting the internet user to enter an identifier the user desires to check for registration on a web site wherein the web site to be checked is not the web site associated with the first processing unit receive an input indicating the user has entered an identifier to be checked and requesting that the identifier be checked on at least one web site and in response to the input going out to the at least one web site and checking if the identifier is in use on the web site and provide a display indicating that the identifier is registered on the web site. Preferably the instructions further include instructions for directing the first processing unit to provide a display showing a plurality of icons each icon representing a different web site and the receiving an input comprises receiving a signal that the user has clicked on one of the icons. Preferably the instructions for directing further comprise instructions for directing the first processing unit to record the web sites on which the identifier is registered.

The invention not only provides a method and apparatus for creating a repository for identity graphs and social graphs without any laborious entering of information but also provides a method and apparatus for allowing users and third parties on the users behalf to manage distribute discover and synchronize their identity information and subsequent social connections online. Numerous other features objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

This disclosure describes a repository and distribution system for collecting users online identities and allowing them to be discovered retrieved and or updated through a central access point by third parties and and other users . The system also includes collection discovery and distribution of a user s social graph that is the user s connections and communities on sites and applications throughout the web see . The system further includes user set permissions see below for access management and sharing of the user s information. The system also provides analytics statistics and normalization for operations and data relating to users behaviors throughout the web see and . Thus the system lends itself to web service or application recommendations and advertising decisions based on the collected identity graphs IGs social graphs SGs and statistics.

It should be understood that in this disclosure the term web site also means web service and application . The term application means a software application that connects to the internet. While we shall try to use the terms web site web service and application throughout this disclosure it should be understood that the use of one includes the others. It should also be understood that the system described herein is currently in the state of development and those skilled in the art will recognized that many of the elements will be changed in further development iterations. For example to accelerate the pace of development software shortcuts are sometimes taken. Thus it should be recognized that the disclosure is not meant to limit the application but is intended to be exemplary. It is expected that those skilled in the art will be able to create many variations and more sophisticated versions of the application.

Turning now to one embodiment of a collection of identity graphs and are shown. The user represented by identity graph has identities on n web sites or applications through . The specific name the user has on each web site or application may be the same or different. However even if the names are the same each web site or application can result in a different identity since the fact that that person is associated with a particular web site is preferably part of the identity graph. These identities are collected by the system of the invention into the identity graph . Each of the users represented by identity graphs and has identities respectively on m p q and r respectively different web services or applications and these identities are collected into identity graphs and respectively. The users represented by identity graphs and have relationships with the user represented by IG on a first web site or application. These relationships form a part of the social graph of the user with identity graph . They also will form part of the social graph of each of the users with IG s through though this is not specifically indicated in the figure.

Another way the IG and SG information may be collected by repository is to at the request of the user go to the various web sites and applications on which the user has an identity and retrieve the information. The system provides a widget which shall be describe below and simply by clicking on an icon for the web site or application the user can use the widget to retrieve information as the user desires. A third way that the system may collect IG or SG information is for the user to enter the information directly via link . With permission of the user the system according to the invention also enables the sharing of the information in repository with any interested third party . This will also be described below. This sharing through link provides an additional method for IG or SG information to be passed to repository . Whenever shared information is updated by a third party this updated information may be transferred back to the repository. In addition the sharing function encourages third parties to sign up on the system and thus enhances the collection of information.

Turning to and there is shown exemplary documentation describing a portion of the method in which third party web services and applications and may interact with the repository . is shown out of order because the call function for contacts could be completed only after much of the other software was developed. Specifically and describe how a third party web service or application can obtain an API key and pull IG SG information from the repository and push IG SG information into the repository. illustrates a preferred embodiment according to the invention of documentation of an API call to obtain an identity graph of an Internet user. The documentation first describes the usefulness of the call i.e. to learn more about a particular user s other on line services and explains that the lookup is preferably done via an email address. However lookups can also be done via other identifiers particularly if the user requests it. It also notes that the system does not return anything without the user s permission which is provided via a permissions page see below or otherwise such as through the web service via the API or via the widget described below. The GET is shown at . The get directs the call to the system web site services engine and indicates at that the request must include an API key and at that it must include a user identifier. The GET request parameters are described at and include a parameter column a type column and a description column . As indicated both the API key and the user identifier are preferably strings. We shall discuss below how the caller gets an API key and user identifier and the preferred form of the API key and the user identifier.

The documentation describes the values returned by the call at which description includes a parameter column a type column and a description column . All the parameters are preferably strings. The first parameter returned svcid is the ID of the service in the repository . The second parameter svcName is the displayable name of the web service and is used to output information to users. The fourth parameter returned usrSvcid is the unique identifier of the user on the particular web service. As we will see below the user can specify this. The last parameter returned URL is the URL to the user s public portfolio on the particular service.

A feature of the data returns is that the data is extensible. Attributes of an internet user s identity can be easily added or removed without affecting the overall integrity or usability of the data structure. One web service or user can request a first set of attributes and another web service or user can request another set of attributes. If a set of attributes is available but not requested it can easily be skipped by the return. Preferably all data stored in the repository is similarly extensible.

Page also provides a variety of badges and that also can be generated on any web site or application by copying the code or widget corresponding to that badge to the desired web site or application. The appropriate widget is dynamically presented in the window by clicking on the corresponding button etc. A variety of different badges of a variety of sizes and shapes are provided so that a user or a web service or application can find one that integrates easily into the desired web page or application. Any of the badges such as is a link to a page that is shown in or which will be discussed below.

It should be understood that a widget function such as just described can be created for each of the relationships of a particular user. below illustrates a call used for transporting the user s social graph See . That is the user s social graph can be transported to any web site or function in the same manner as just described for the user s identity graph. In summary the widget function shown in permits any user or a web service or application preferably with permission from the user to retrieve and display the user s identities off the repository site and the widget function of permits any user web service or application with permission of the user to retrieve and display the user s contacts off the repository site . It allows anyone to create an identity graph such as or a social graph such as in on any web site. For example an individual user can build an identity graph of herself or himself an identity graph of each of their friends and a social graph of themselves and their friends on their own blog or any other site. The social graph function discussed below displays to a user all their friends on particular web sites and allows the user to designate whether each individual friend should also be a friend on other web sites that on which the friend is registered. This can be done individually for each web site or application and each friend or be done globally for all web sites or applications and or for all friends. In addition a web site or application using the widget of can take a similar action via calls to the API which allows the web site to retrieve and or display social graph information of their users. In short the invention makes identities identity graphs relationships and social graphs easily portable.

The View My Profile button takes the user to this page and is available on most pages of the system . The In Box button takes the user to a page that permits the user to send and receive messages. The My Profile button takes the user to a page such as shown in that permits the user to edit the user s profile. The My Identities button takes the user to a page such as which allows the user to edit and manage the user s identities on the user s services. The My Contacts button takes the user to a page on which the user can edit his or her contacts. The Share function of button will be explained in connection with below. The analytics function will be discussed in connection with below. The My API profile button takes the user to a page such as which permits a user to obtain and modify an API key. The Social Rank number at shows the percentile rank of the user in relation to all users of the repository site in terms of numbers of different web services on which the user is registered. The process of determining this ranking will be discussed in connection with .

The People Search feature shown in is on many pages of the web site generated by repository management system and is a very useful feature of the invention. Clicking on the arrow opens a drop down menu listing the service IDs of all the web sites and applications in the list of . Clicking on one of the service IDs in the drop down menu enters it in box . Entering an identifier in box and activating the search button will take you to the public profile in the repository management system of the user associated with that particular identifier on the web service or application entered in box . Thus if you know the identifier that a friend uses on a particular web site or application you can find their public profile on the web service of the repository management system . As can be seen from the URL this particular example of a page was brought up by entering the Twitter service ID in box and Sara Czyzewicz s identifier sara in box and clicking on the search button . Then by using any of the icons the user that found Sara on the web site according to the invention can then easily go to the public profile page of Sara on any of the web sites on which she is registered. Thus it is evident that the combination of the People Search feature and the icon summary allows a user to discover the entire web identity of any friend who has entered the appropriate permissions. As an example shows the public profile page of Sara Czyzewicz on the LAST.FM web site. This public profile page was reached by clicking on the LAST.FM icon on Sara s public page of the repository management system of the invention . Note that Sara s identifier for this web site is saraolive which is different from her identifier on Twitter. In this way one has obtained a new identifier of Sara and can use it to find her on other web sites. An easy way of doing this is to enter saraolive in the search box of the Manage Services page which will automatically show each of the web sites and applications on which this identifier is used. A feature of the invention that is being implemented is to automatically perform the entire search and discovery function given just one identifier of a friend.

While the People Search feature has been described in terms of a window and drop down menu it should be understood the same function can be accessed in other ways. For example in a current embodiment it is available via an API. That is third parties can request the same information from the repository via an API extension to that described above. Those skilled in the art will understand how this is implemented from the above discussions.

The normalization process is started at . At information relating to form and code for operations interactions data requests and data for social space web sites and applications is collected and stored. At the system provides a web page to permit users to enter their preferences for form of operations interactions and data requests. User information is collected at preferably as in profile page . The system provides at a web page or pages for a user to input desired operations interactions and or data requests and designation s of web site s and or application s on which operations interactions and or data requests are to be performed. At operations interactions data requests and or data are translated to the appropriate form s and code s for the user designated web site s and or application s . At the system communicates with designated web site s and or application s to perform the user desired operations interactions and or data requests. The system then at confirms to the user that the desired operations interactions and or data requests have been performed on designated web sites. At upon receiving a user request the system provides a web page or pages for the user to update information and or make new requests for operations interactions and or data requests then displays or otherwise communicates to the user the user operations interactions and or data requests to be made to update user s information and actions on web site s and or applications s and gives the user an opportunity to edit the same. The system then at receives user input translates the operations interactions data requests and or data to the appropriate form s and code s for the designated web site s and or application s and finally performs the newly requested operations interactions and or data requests and update user information on designated web sites. The process then ends at though it may be re entered at at any time.

The Site States page is shown in . As indicated at the Site Stats show a breakdown of the percentage of total accesses of the user s profile page that are coming from each of the web services to which the identity graph of the user has been ported. The percentage as a number is shown in column the percentage in the form of a bar graph is shown in column and the URL of the web service is shown in column . Again by clicking on one of the buttons in row the user can choose between the accesses in the last 24 hours the accesses in the last seven days the accesses in the last 30 days and the accesses in the last 365 days. As indicated in the Site Stats 87.5 of the accesses in the last twenty four hours have been through DandyID 6.25 have been through Facebook and 6.25 of the accesses have been through TheMissSmithWebsite presumably because the user is listed there as a contact. Only a portion of site stats are shown in to conserve space. The Users analytics button accesses a page which shows the other DandyID users who have clicked through to view your page on one or more of your services. This page is not shown as its form is similar to that of . On this page each user is shown in one column percentage of accesses via that user is shown in a bar graph and the number of times that user has accessed one of your services as well as the numerical percentage is shown in another column.

Turning to the web page requests basic information about the user at . As indicated at this information may be pulled from the DandyID user profile and if the information is not available the user is notified by email. Conventional user identification is entered at box . At the user is provided an additional option called Pro Pack Plus which allows the user to add the user s website URL and biography to the three hundred web sites or services by checking box . A space is provided to enter a short one sentence biography and a space is provided at to enter a longer biography. The URL may be entered at . At legal requirements are met by requiring the user to certify that the user is the owner or authorized representative of the owner of the identifier username by checking box and indicating that the user has read the terms of use and privacy policy and to authorized DandyID to act on behalf of the user by checking box . When all the information is provided the user may check out by clicking on box which takes the user to a payment page.

A feature of the invention is the manner of collecting the statistics discussed above. Preferably all access to links available on or via the repository can be normalized. That is all links point toward a URL associated with the invention which then redirects to the link s final destination. For example the URL associated with the profile shown in is http www.dandyid.org id sara and if a user were to access Sara s Facebook profile by clicking on the Facebook icon the link would go to http www.dandyid.org id sara facebook. Thus while the http www.dandyid.org id sara site does not appear to be accessed except for perhaps for a temporary flicker of the screen the access actually passes through the invention before the user is directed to Sara s profile at http www.facebook.com saraczyzewicz. As it passes through the invention numerous statistics are collected including the date and time the referring site referring host ip address etc. It should also be noted that type of URL redirection sometimes referred to as URL forwarding used by the invention in this process affects the ranking of the link s final destination in popular search engines. Thus the invention provides the ability for users to explicitly manage the type of URL redirection used in the process.

The invention also includes a permissions page though this is not expressly shown as it is similar to pages already discussed and will be clear from these discussions. A permissions page includes a listing similar to of all the web services application and users registered with the repository management system . For each such entity there are entries preferably each under a separate column for the user to grant specific permissions such as the permission to share public data the permission to share certain data such as photographs or relationships the permission to share private data or only specific private data such as email addresses. A user can grant permissions globally globally for specific permissions or individually. The permissions can be for within the repository web site or for other web sites either individually or globally. Permissions are preferably data specific. That is permissions for a first piece of data may be different for a second piece of data. For example one my restrict viewing of data on Twitter to only specific family members while viewing of data on LinkedIn is restricted only to professional contacts. One listing similar to for web sites and applications is generated by activating a Service Permissions button and another listing of individual users is generated by clicking a User Permissions button. Preferably the User Permissions button activates a drop down menu with a set of alphabetic buttons a b c d etc. each of which generates the users whose identities begin with that letter of the alphabet. Service Permissions button may also activate a drop down menu that allows selection of services either alphabetically or by service types or both.

A feature of the invention is that it provides an identity graph and the ability for a user to manage the identity graph and makes the identity graph portable to other web sites and applications.

A related feature of the invention is that it provides an social graph and the ability for a user to manage the social graph and makes the social graph portable to other web sites and applications.

Another feature of the invention is that it permits identity and social graph discovery autodiscovery recording and updating.

Still another feature of the invention is that it provides an identity graph and social graph analysis and statistics package which are also portable to different web sites.

Yet another feature of the invention is that it provides for normalization of actions and data over the social web site and applications space particularly that space relating to identity graphs and social graphs.

There has been described a novel system and method for creation portability and normalization of actions and data in the social web and application space. The identity and social graphs and the openness of the system results in a highly desirable comprehensive and decentralized internet identity graph social graph and repository management system. The system is simple universal and economical without requiring any additional data entry above what normally occurs when individuals register at a web site. In fact the system reduces the requirement for data entry since the system requires only one entry to normalize data across the entire social web space and is able to go out and find all identities of a user if only one is known as well as find all web sites and applications to which a target user belongs. This reduces internet traffic because one does not have to get this information by trial and error. It also reduces internet traffic in that it significantly lowers the numbers of errors in performing actions and entering data since each user selects a preferred system. Since the user constantly uses the same form of actions and data it is easier for the user to remember how to perform actions and the names for different types of data. A feature that significantly reduces internet traffic is that all the web sites and applications on which a user is registered can be managed from a single site. The invention has numerous other novel features and advantages. For example the invention can be integrated into any web site at little cost or labor.

It should be understood that the particular embodiments shown in the drawings and described within this specification are for purposes of example and should not be construed to limit the invention which will be described in the claims below. Further it is evident that those skilled in the art may now make numerous uses and modifications of the specific embodiment described without departing from the inventive concepts. Equivalent structures and processes may be substituted for the various structures and processes described the subprocesses of the inventive method may in some instances be performed in a different order or a variety of different structural embodiments and elements may be used. Consequently the invention is to be construed as embracing each and every novel feature and novel combination of features present in and or possessed by the identity and social graph repository management apparatus and methods described.
