This application is a continuation in part of U.S. Ser. No. 12 402 484 filed Mar. 11 2009 which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e 1 to provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61 035 706 filed Mar. 11 2008. These applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

This invention relates generally to the treatment of edema and more particularly relates to methods for the treatment of edema e.g. lower leg edema using a topically applied formulation and to formulations useful in that method.

Inflammation is a complex biological response of vascular tissue to harmful stimuli such as oxidative stress irritants pathogens and damaged cells. It is a protective attempt by the organism to remove an injurious stimulus and initiate the healing process for injured tissue. The inflammatory response involves the production and release of inflammatory modulators that function to both destroy damaged cells and heal injured tissue. In order to perform this function however various inflammatory modulators either directly produce and or signal the release of agents that produce reactive oxygen species for the purpose of destroying invading agents and or injured cells. The inflammatory response therefore involves a balance between the destruction of damaged cells and the healing of injured tissue since an imbalance can lead to oxidative stress and the onset of various inflammatory disease pathologies.

One manifestation of the inflammatory process in the body is edema the term edema referring to the accumulation of excess fluid within body tissues. Not all edema however has been established as caused by or associated with inflammation. Edema may be systemic in nature as in congestive heart failure renal failure or pulmonary edema or localized. Localized edema generally involves swelling of the arms or legs with lower leg edema particularly common. The effects of localized edema are well known. Patients can be somewhat to significantly disabled as a substantial volume of fluid can accumulate in the affected limb or limbs. Normal everyday activities can become severely limited. Elderly people are particularly susceptible to development of localized edema since the elderly frequently suffer from medical conditions in which blood flow is limited or decreased and or take medications that can give rise to edema. The most common reason for edema in many people is chronic venous insufficiency.

Although treatment of the underlying pathology if such treatment is possible will normally reduce edemic swelling treatment is often unavailable or only partially effective. Lymphedema for example is a chronic condition that cannot be cured. One solution that is used in alleviating edema particularly in the management of lymphedema is compression therapy. That is the swollen limb is wrapped and compressed to reduce and or disseminate the localized accumulated fluid. For example the ReidSleeve Peninsula Medical Inc. is a compression device formed of a flexible synthetic material which is strapped on to a patient s limb at the site of swelling and then tightened see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 904 145 5 916 183 and 5 196 231 to Reid . See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 759 164 to Pacey and U.S. Pat. No. 5 830 164 to Cone et al. both of which also describe devices for applying pressure to an edemic limb. The use of such compression bandaging has provided some beneficial results to patients but is potentially harmful unless the amount of pressure applied is carefully controlled and regularly monitored. Otherwise application of significant pressure can exacerbate the patient s condition or cause additional problems by excessively reducing or even blocking blood circulation. While these types of devices can be safely and effectively applied by the medical practitioner once the patient is home and applying the compression sleeve without guidance its use becomes risky.

Pharmacological agents have also been proposed for use in treating localized edema such agents are typically selected from those drugs normally used in the treatment of generalized inflammation e.g. NSAIDs such as aspirin ibuprofen and the like corticosteroids and antihistamines. These agents can provide some degree of improvement but relief is often minimal and short lived. There are no known treatments that provide significant and lasting relief from localized edema.

In one aspect of the invention a method is provided for treating a patient afflicted with localized edema. Generally although not necessarily the edema results from chronic venous insufficiency and the edema may or may not be associated with or caused by an inflammatory condition e.g. an inflammatory response or inflammatory disease. The method involves topically administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a metal ion sequestering agent also referred to herein as a metal ion sequestrant or simply as a sequestrant and an effective permeation enhancing amount of a permeation enhancer e.g. methylsulfonylmethane. Topically administering the formulation as that term is used herein means that the formulation is applied to the body surface typically the skin. The sequestrant is capable of sequestering e.g. chelating or otherwise sequestering metal ions including metal ions that may be directly or indirectly causing the condition responsible for the edema. The permeation enhancer acts to increase the rate at which the metal ion sequestrant penetrates the body surface and therefore also increases the amount of sequestrant that is delivered relative to the rate and amount that would be observed in the absence of the permeation enhancer.

The sequestrant and the enhancer are generally although not necessarily administered in a single formulation in which the two components are combined e.g. a cream lotion gel or the like. The method may however also involve separate administration of the sequestrant and enhancer.

In another aspect of the invention a topical formulation is provided for the treatment of localized edema. The formulation contains a therapeutically effective amount of a metal ion sequestrant and an effective permeation enhancing amount of a permeation enhancer as described above. By an effective amount of each of the foregoing components is meant that when a dose e.g. a unit dose of the formulation is topically applied the concentration of the sequestrant provides a therapeutically effective amount of the sequestrant and the concentration of the permeation enhancer provides an effective permeation enhancing amount. The formulation also contains a pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier including one or more inert additives i.e. excipients as will be explained infra. Optionally when used to treat localized edema resulting from inflammation the topical formulation may also contain an anti inflammatory agent.

Any recited method can be carried out in the order of events recited or in any other order that is logically possible.

Unless otherwise indicated the invention is not limited to specific formulation components active agents dosage regimens or the like as such may vary.

The present invention provides methods and formulations for the treatment of a subject with localized edema which generally although not necessarily is caused by chronic venous insufficiency. The edema may or may not be caused by or associated with inflammation. As noted above treatment of the localized edema encompasses prevention of localized edema in a susceptible individual as well as treatment of a clinically symptomatic individual.

In one embodiment a method of treating localized edema in a patient involves topical administration at the site of the edema of 1 a therapeutically effective amount of a metal ion sequestrant e.g. a chelating agent and 2 an effective permeation enhancing amount of a permeation enhancer. The metal ion sequestrant is capable of sequestering metal ions that are associated in some way with a dysfunctional process typically a dysfunctional inflammatory process. For instance metal ions such as Fe2 and Fe3 may act as catalysts in oxidative reactions in the extracellular milieu thereby reducing the availability of such reactive metal ions for participating in the production of reactive oxygen species. An elevated concentration of calcium cation Ca2 is associated with oxidative stress i.e. an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species which can in turn lead to a number of physiological problems.

The aforementioned method will generally although not necessarily involve topical administration of the metal ion sequestrant and the enhancer in a single formulation e.g. a cream lotion gel or the like.

The permeation enhancer is essentially a transport enhancing agent i.e. the enhancer facilitates transport of the sequestrant and any pharmacologically active agent present e.g. an anti inflammatory agent into and through the body surface and into body tissues and membranes e.g. into and through phospholipid membranes into cells and in certain instances into the organelles thereof such as the nucleus and or mitochondria. The permeation enhancing amount of the enhancer refers to an amount that is effective 1 to increase the rate of permeation of a formulation component particularly the sequestrant and any active agent present through the body surface and into the underlying tissues and or 2 to increase the amount of a formulation component particularly the sequestrant and any active agent present that penetrates through the body surface and into the underlying tissues.

Generally the metal ion sequestrants can be divided into two categories chelators and complexing ligands.

The word chelator comes from the Greek word chele which means claw or pincer. As the name implies metals that are complexed with chelators form a claw like structure consisting of one or more molecules. The metal chelate structure may be circular and may include 5 or 6 member rings that are structurally and chemically stable.

Chelators can be classified by two different methods. One method is by their use they may be classified as extraction type and color forming type. Extractions with chelators may be for preparative or analytical purposes. The chelating extraction reaction generally consists of addition of a chelator to a metal containing solution or material to selectively extract the metal or metals of interest. The color forming type of chelators including pyridylazonaphthol PAN pyridylazoresorcinol PAR thioazoylazoresorcinol TAR and many others have been used in analytical chemistry for many years. The chemistry is similar to that of the extraction type except that the color forming chelator will form a distinctive color in the presence or absence of a targeted metal. Generally the types of functional groups that form the chelate complex are similar however a color forming chelator will be water soluble due to the addition of polar or ionic functional groups such as a sulfonic acid group to the chelating molecule.

Another method of classifying chelators is according to whether or not the formation of the metal chelate complex results in charge neutralization. Chelators often contain hydronium ions from a carboxylic acid or hydroxy functional group that result in charge neutralization e.g. 8 hydroxyquinoline. Other chelators are non ionic and simply bind to the metal thereby conserving the charge of the metal e.g. ethylene diamine or 1 10 phenanthroline. Chelators sometimes have one acidic group and one basic group which upon chelation with the metal ion form a ring structure. Typical acidic groups are carboxylic acid COOH hydroxyl OH phenolic or enolic sulfhydryl SH hydroxylamino NH OH and arsonic acid AsO OH . Typical basic groups include oxo O and primary secondary and tertiary amine groups. Virtually all organic functional groups have been incorporated into chelators.

A complexing ligand may not form a ring structure but may still be able to form strong complexes with the metal atom. An example of a complexing ligand is cyanide which can form strong complexes with certain metals such as Fe and Cu. Free cyanide is used to complex and extract gold metal from ore. One or more of the ligands can complex with the metals depending on the ligand and ligand concentration.

It is possible to add selectivity to the complexation reaction. Some metal ion sequestrants are very selective for a particular metal. For example dimethylglyoxime forms a planar structure with Ni and selectively extracts the metal. Selectivity can be moderated by adjusting the pH. When an acidic group is present the chelator is made more general by increasing pH and more selective by decreasing the pH. Only metals that form the strongest chelators will form metal chelates under increasingly acidic conditions. As another example BAPTA selectively chelates calcium ions EGTA chelates both calcium ions and magnesium ions but is more selective for calcium ions and EDTA chelates both iron and calcium ions as well as other dicationic and tricationic metal species.

Chelating or ligand complexers may be used in conjunction with other metal chelators to add selectivity. Masking agents are used as an auxiliary complexing agent to prevent the complexation of certain metals so that others can be complexed. Examples of masking agents include sulfosalicylate which masks Al cyanide which masks Co Ni Cu Cd and Zn thiourea which masks Cu citrate which masks Al Sn and Zr and iodide which masks Hg.

Table 1 indicates some of the more common metal complexers and some of the cations with which they form complexes. In the table the abbreviations used in the category headings are as follows E extraction CF color forming CN charge neutralizing and NCN no charge neutralization.

The listing of cations in this table should not be taken to be exclusive. Many of these sequestrants will complex to some extent with many metal cations.

Compounds useful as metal ion sequestrants herein include any compounds that coordinate to or form complexes with a divalent or polyvalent metal cation although sequestration of calcium and iron cations is typically preferred. Preferred metal ion sequestrants herein are basic addition salts of a polyacid e.g. a polycarboxylic acid a polysulfonic acid or a polyphosphonic acid with polycarboxylates particularly preferred.

With respect to suitable sequestrants chelators ligands and other species that act as iron sequestrants for example include the siderophores desferrioxamine deferoxamine DFO desferrioxamine B Desferal and desferrithiocin desferri exochelin 4 3 5 bis hydroxyphenyl 1 2 4 triazol 1 yl benzoic acid ICL670A 4 hydroxydesazadesferrithiocin 4 5 dihydro 2 2 4 dihydroxyphenyl 4 methylthiazole 4 carboxylic acid deferitrin deferiprone 1 2 dimethyl 3 hydroxypyridin 4 one hydroxypyridinone analogs aroylhydrazones such as pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone and analogs thereof e.g. 2 pyridylcarboxaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone and its analogs and di 2 pyridylketone isonicotinoyl hydrazone and its analogs thiosemicarbazones such as triapine 3 aminopyridine 2 carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone the polyamino carboxylic acid ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid EDTA and salts thereof N N di 2 hydroxybenzyl ethylenediamine N N diacetic acid HCl HBED deferasirox hydroxamic acid analogs such as 4 aminophenylhydroxamic acid 2 aminophenylhydroxamic acid and salicylhydroxamic acid rhodotorulic acid N N bis 2 hydroxybenzyl prop ylene 1 3 diamine N N diacetic acid HBPD 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid and diethyltriamine pentaacetic acid DTPA .

Suitable metal ion sequestrants include monomeric polyacids such as EDTA EGTA BAPTA cyclohexanediamine tetraacetic acid CDTA hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine triacetic acid HEDTA diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid DTPA dimercaptopropane sulfonic acid DMPS dimercaptosuccinic acid DMSA aminotrimethylene phosphonic acid ATPA citric acid pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof and combinations of any of the foregoing. Other exemplary metal ion sequestrants include phosphates e.g. pyrophosphates tripolyphosphates and hexametaphosphates chelating antibiotics such as chloroquine and tetracycline nitrogen containing chelating agents containing two or more chelating nitrogen atoms within an imino group or in an aromatic ring e.g. diimines 2 2 bipyridines etc. and polyamines such as cyclam 1 4 7 11 tetraazacyclotetradecane N C1 C30 alkyl substituted cyclams e.g. hexadecyclam tetramethylhexadecylcyclam diethylenetriamine DETA spermine diethylnorspermine DENSPM diethylhomo spermine DEHOP deferoxamine N 5 4 5 acetylhydroxyamino pentyl amino 1 4 dioxobutyl hydroxyamino pentyl N 5 aminopentyl N hydroxybutanediamide also known as desferrioxamine B and DFO deferiprone pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone PIH salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone SIH ethane 1 2 bis N 1 amino 3 ethylbutyl 3 thiol .

Additional metal ion sequestrant that may be useful for the practice of the current disclosure include EDTA 4 aminoquinoline conjugates such as 2 bis ethoxycarbonylmethyl amino ethyl 2 7 chloro quinolin 4 ylamino ethylcarbamoyl methyl amino acetic acid ethyl ester 2 bis ethoxycarbonylmethyl amino propyl 2 7 chloro quinolin 4 ylamino ethylcarbamoyl methyl amino acetic acid ethyl ester 3 bis ethoxycarbonylmethyl amino propyl 2 7 chloro quinolin 4 ylamino ethylcarbamoyl methyl amino acetic acid ethyl ester 4 bis ethoxycarbonylmethyl amino butyl 2 7 chloro quinolin 4 ylamino ethylcarbamoyl methyl amino acetic acid ethyl ester 2 bis ethoxymethyl amino ethyl 2 7 chloro quinolin 4 ylamino ethylcarbamoyl methyl amino acetic acid ethyl ester 2 bis ethoxymethyl amino propyl 2 7 chloro quinolin 4 ylamino ethylcarbamoyl methyl amino acetic acid ethyl ester 3 bis ethoxymethyl amino propyl 2 7 chloro quinolin 4 ylamino ethylcarbamoyl methyl amino acetic acid ethyl ester 4 bis ethoxymethyl amino butyl 2 7 chloro quinolin 4 ylamino ethylcarbamoyl methyl amino acetic acid ethyl ester as described in Solomon et al. 2006 2 133 138.

The metal ion sequestrant is included in the topical formulations herein in a therapeutically effective amount i.e. at a concentration that provides a therapeutically effective amount when a single dose of the formulation is administered topically. Generally the concentration of the sequestrant is in the range of about 0.6 wt. to about 10 wt. for instance about 1.0 wt. to about 5.0 wt. .

The disclosure is not unless otherwise indicated limited with regard to specific metal ion sequestrants and any such agents can be used providing in general that they are capable of being buffered to a pH in the range of about 6.5 to about 8.0 and does not interact with any other component of the formulation. EDTA and pharmacologically acceptable EDTA salts may be advantageously used. Representative pharmacologically acceptable EDTA salts are typically selected from diammonium EDTA disodium EDTA dipotassium EDTA triammonium EDTA trisodium EDTA tripotassium EDTA and calcium disodium EDTA. EDTA has been widely used as an agent for chelating metals in biological tissue and blood. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6 348 508 to Denick Jr. et al. describes EDTA as a sequestrant to bind metal ions. In addition to its use as a chelating agent EDTA has also been widely used as a preservative in place of benzalkonium chloride as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 211 238 to Castillo et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 265 444 to Bowman et al. discloses use of EDTA as a preservative and stabilizer.

With respect to the enhancer the compound or compounds used should be present in an effective permeation enhancing amount wherein the effective permeation enhancing amount of the enhancer generally represents a concentration that is sufficient to provide a measurable increase in the rate of permeation of one or more formulation components e.g. the sequestrant through the body surface and into underlying tissues and or an increase in the amount of a formulation component e.g. the sequestrant that permeates through the body surface and into underlying tissues. The increase in the rate of permeation and or amount permeated represents an increase relative to that which would be observed in the absence of the enhancer.

The invention is not limited with respect to the mechanism by which the enhancer increases permeation of formulation components through the patient s body surface penetration into underlying tissues. The enhancer should be selected such that it enables penetration permeation and transport of the metal ion sequestrant as explained above. The enhancer should have minimal or no toxicity and any degradation products should have minimal or no toxicity as well.

wherein Rand Rare independently selected from C Calkyl preferably C Calkyl C Cheteroalkyl preferably C Cheteroalkyl C Caralkyl preferably C Caralkyl and C Cheteroaralkyl preferably C Cheteroaralkyl and Q is S or P. Compounds wherein Q is S and Rand Rare C Calkyl are particularly preferred.

The phrase having the formula or having the structure is not intended to be limiting and is used in the same way that the term comprising is commonly used. With respect to the above structure the term alkyl refers to a linear branched or cyclic saturated hydrocarbon group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methyl ethyl n propyl isopropyl n butyl isobutyl t butyl cyclopentyl cyclohexyl and the like. If not otherwise indicated the term alkyl includes unsubstituted and substituted alkyl wherein the substituents may be for example halo hydroxyl sulfhydryl alkoxy acyl etc. The term alkoxy intends an alkyl group bound through a single terminal ether linkage that is an alkoxy group may be represented as O alkyl where alkyl is as defined above. The term aryl refers to an aromatic substituent containing a single aromatic ring or multiple aromatic rings that are fused together directly linked or indirectly linked such that the different aromatic rings are bound to a common group such as a methylene or ethylene moiety . Preferred aryl groups contain 5 to 14 carbon atoms. Exemplary aryl groups are contain one aromatic ring or two fused or linked aromatic rings e.g. phenyl naphthyl biphenyl diphenylether diphenylamine benzophenone and the like. Aryl includes unsubstituted and substituted aryl wherein the substituents may be as set forth above with respect to optionally substituted alkyl groups. The term aralkyl refers to an alkyl group with an aryl substituent wherein aryl and alkyl are as defined above. Preferred aralkyl groups contain 6 to 14 carbon atoms and particularly preferred aralkyl groups contain 6 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of aralkyl groups include without limitation benzyl 2 phenyl ethyl 3 phenyl propyl 4 phenyl butyl 5 phenyl pentyl 4 phenylcyclohexyl 4 benzylcyclohexyl 4 phenylcyclohexylmethyl 4 benzylcyclohexylmethyl and the like. The term acyl refers to substituents having the formula CO alkyl CO aryl or CO aralkyl wherein alkyl aryl and aralkyl are as defined above. The terms heteroalkyl and heteroaralkyl are used to refer to heteroatom containing alkyl and aralkyl groups respectively i.e. alkyl and aralkyl groups in which one or more carbon atoms is replaced with an atom other than carbon e.g. nitrogen oxygen sulfur phosphorus or silicon typically nitrogen oxygen or sulfur.

Suitable enhancers include methylsulfonylmethane MSM also referred to as methyl sulfone dimethyl sulfone and DMSO and or combinations of MSM with dimethylsulfoxide DMSO . MSM is an odorless highly water soluble 34 w v at 79 F. white crystalline compound with a melting point of 108 110 C. and a molecular weight of 94.1 g mol. MSM is thought to serve as a multifunctional agent herein insofar as the agent not only increases the permeability of biological membranes such as cell membranes but also facilitates the transport of one or more formulation components throughout the layers of the skin i.e. epidermis dermis and subcutaneous fat layers as well as across mucus membranes endothelial layers and the like. Furthermore MSM per se is known to provide medicative effects and can serve as an anti inflammatory agent as well as an analgesic. MSM also acts to improve oxidative metabolism in biological tissues and is a source of organic sulfur which may assist in the reduction of scarring. MSM additionally possesses beneficial solubilization properties in that it is soluble in water as noted above but exhibits both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties because of the presence of polar S O groups and nonpolar methyl groups. The molecular structure of MSM also allows for hydrogen bonding with other molecules i.e. between the oxygen atom of each S O group and hydrogen atoms of other molecules and for formation of van der Waals associations i.e. between the methyl groups and nonpolar e.g. hydrocarbyl segments of other molecules.

The present formulations may contain in addition to the MSM or MSM DMSO combination one or more additional permeation enhancers. Such enhancers are known to those in the field of topical and transdermal drug delivery and include by way of example alkanols such as ethanol ethers such as diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and diethylene glycol monomethyl ether surfactants such as sodium laurate sodium lauryl sulfate cetyltrimethylammonium bromide benzalkonium chloride Poloxamer 231 182 184 Tween 20 40 60 80 and lecithin fatty acids such as lauric acid oleic acid and valeric acid fatty acid esters such as isopropyl myristate isopropyl palmitate methylpropionate and ethyl oleate polyols and esters thereof such as propylene glycol ethylene glycol glycerol butanediol polyethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol monolaurate PEGML see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 568 343 and amides and other nitrogenous compounds such as urea dimethylacetamide DMA dimethylformamide DMF 2 pyrrolidone 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidone ethanolamine diethanolamine and triethanolamine.

The methods and formulations herein may involve use of two or more metal ion sequestrants used in combination and or two or more enhancers used in combination. For example a formulation of the disclosure can contain DMSO in addition to MSM. Since MSM is a metabolite of DMSO i.e. DMSO is enzymatically converted to MSM incorporating DMSO into an MSM containing formulation of the disclosure will tend to gradually increase the fraction of MSM in the formulation. DMSO may also serve as a free radical scavenger thereby reducing the potential for oxidative damage. If DMSO is added as a secondary enhancer the amount is preferably in the range of about 1.0 wt. to 2.0 wt. of the formulation and the weight ratio of MSM to DMSO is typically in the range of about 1 1 to about 50 1.

A factor that appears to be related to the performance of the present formulations is the molar ratio of the enhancer to the metal ion sequestrant. The molar ratio of the enhancer to the sequestrant is generally in the range of about 2 1 to about 12 1. The preferred molar ratio of the enhancer to the sequestrant is in the range of about 4 1 to about 10 1 more preferably in the range of about 6 1 to about 8 1 e.g. 8 1. Generally but preferably within the limits defined by the aforementioned molar ratio ranges the concentration of the enhancer is on the order of a few percent by weight for example in the range of about 1 wt. to about 8 wt. typically in the range of about 2 wt. to about 6 wt. . For example when the enhancer is MSM per se and the sequestrant is EDTA a concentration of about 2.5 wt EDTA and about 5 wt MSM may be used.

The formulations herein may consist essentially of the metal ion sequestrant and the enhancer such that no additional therapeutic agents are incorporated although various excipients carriers preservatives and the like will typically be present.

In an alternative embodiment the formulation may include an added anti inflammatory agent in a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount as explained elsewhere herein the term therapeutic is generally intended to encompass prophylactic use as well .

Any suitable anti inflammatory agent in any suitable amount may be used so long as the anti inflammatory agent is capable of being combined with the metal ion sequestrant and or enhancer components to provide a formulation that is capable of preventing and or treating localized edema that is directly or indirectly caused by an underlying inflammatory condition. Thus in this embodiment the present invention encompasses a formulation comprising one or more metal ion sequestrants one or more enhancers and one or more anti inflammatory agents. Accordingly a suitable anti inflammatory agent may be one or more of those described herein below.

In addition to medical drugs including but not limited to those described above many herbs have anti inflammatory qualities including hyssop ginger Arnica montana which contains helenalin a sesquiterpene lactone and willow bark which contains salicylic acid a substance related to the active ingredient in aspirin. These herbs are encompassed by the present disclosure and one or more herbs can be combined in a formulation with one or more chelators and one or more enhancers.

A variety of means can be used to prepare the topical formulations of the invention. Techniques for pharmaceutical formulation and administration may be found in Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy Twentieth Edition Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 1995 . For human or animal administration preparations should meet sterility pyrogenicity and general safety and purity standards comparable to those required by the FDA. Administration of the pharmaceutical formulation can be performed in a variety of ways as described herein.

The amount of the formulation administered the relative amounts of each component therein e.g. metal ion sequestrant enhancer anti inflammatory agent etc. and the dosage regimen will depend on a number of factors and will vary from subject to subject and depend on for example the severity of the localized edema symptoms the subject s age weight and general condition and the judgment of the prescribing physician.

The formulations of the invention are administered topically to a patient at the site of the localized edema. The term topical administration is used in its conventional sense to mean delivery e.g. process of applying or spreading one or more formulations according to the instant disclosure onto the body surface to a predetermined area of skin or mucosa of a subject where one or more of the components of the formulation permeates through the upper layers of the body surface and into the underlying tissues. The formulation is applied to a predetermined area of skin or mucosal tissue wherein that area is usually be in the range of about 15 cmto about 800 cm more usually in the range of about 20 cmto about 700 cm most typically in the range of about 25 cmto about 600 cm. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art of drug delivery however that the area of skin or mucosal tissue through which drug is administered may vary significantly depending on the extent of the localized edema.

With ointments creams lotions gels etc. the concentration of each active agent in the formulation should be sufficient to enable delivery of a unit dose by application of about 0.5 g to about 30.0 g of the formulation typically in the range of about 0.5 g to about 10.0 g of the formulation most typically in the range of about 1.0 g to about 7.5 g of the formulation.

Suitable formulations for topical administration include lotions creams gels ointments pastes and the like with lotions creams and gels particularly preferred. Topical formulations may also be prepared with liposomes micelles and microspheres.

In addition to the sequestrant and the enhancer the present formulations contain one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers suitable for incorporation into a topically applied composition. These auxiliary agents are pharmaceutically acceptable and may be naturally occurring or may be of synthetic origin. Such optional additives will depend on the formulation type e.g. cream lotion gel or the like but generally include by way of example liquid generally aqueous carriers e.g. water or a hydrogel preservatives thickening agents emulsifying agents pH buffering agents binders coloring agents fragrance and the like. Representative preservatives for use in the present compositions include butylated hydroxyanisole butylated hydroxytoluene chlorobutanol ethylenediamine ethylparaben methylparaben monothioglycerol phenol phenylethyl alcohol propylparaben sodium benzoate sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate sodium metabisulfite sorbic acid sulfur dioxide maleic acid and propyl gallate. Thickening agents include by way of example sodium alginate xanthan gum carrageenans acacia agar gum tragacanth carboxypolymethylene polyvinylpyrrolidone polyacrylamide and cellulosic polymers particularly the more hydrophilic cellulose derivatives. Sodium alginate and xanthan gum are preferred thickening agents.

Pharmaceutical creams are as known in the art viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions either oil in water or water in oil. Cream bases are water washable and contain an oil phase an emulsifier and an aqueous phase. The oil phase also sometimes called the internal phase is generally comprised of petrolatum and a fatty alcohol such as cetyl or stearyl alcohol the aqueous phase usually although not necessarily exceeds the oil phase in volume and generally contains a humectant. The emulsifier in a cream formulation is generally a nonionic anionic cationic or amphoteric surfactant.

Lotions are preparations that may be applied without friction and are typically liquid or semiliquid preparations in which solid particles including the active agent are present in a water or alcohol base along with a suspending agent lotions are typically emulsions of the oil in water type. In general pharmaceutical emulsions are generally formed from a dispersed phase e.g. a pharmacologically active agent a dispersion medium and an emulsifying agent.

A variety of means can be used to prepare the topical formulations of the invention. Techniques for pharmaceutical formulation and administration may be found in Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy Twentieth Edition Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 1995 . For instance formulations such as the creams and lotions described above can be prepared by dispersing the sequestrant and enhancer throughout the vehicle using conventional techniques typically by levigating the sequestrant and enhancer with a small quantity of the cream or lotion base to form a concentrate which is then diluted with additional cream or lotion base. Alternatively a mechanical mixer may be used. Creams lotions and other emulsions may also be prepared using a two phase heat system wherein oil phase ingredients are combined under heat to provide a liquefied uniform system. The aqueous phase ingredients are separately combined using heat. The oil and aqueous phases are then added together with constant agitation and allowed to cool. At this point concentrated agents may be added as a slurry. Volatile or aromatic materials can be added after the emulsion has sufficiently cooled if desired.

The sequestrant and enhancer can also be incorporated into a gel formulation using known techniques. Two phase gel systems generally comprise a suspension or network of small discrete particles interpenetrated by a liquid to provide a dispersed phase and a liquid phase. Single phase gel systems are formed by distributing organic macromolecules uniformly throughout a liquid such that there are no apparent boundaries between the dispersed and liquid phases. Suitable gelling agents for use herein include synthetic macromolecules e.g. carbomers polyvinyl alcohols and polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene copolymers gums such as tragacanth as well as sodium alginate gelatin methylcellulose sodium carboxymethylcellulose methylhydroxyethyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose. In order to prepare a uniform gel dispersing agents such as alcohol or glycerin can be added or the gelling agent can be dispersed by trituration mechanical mixing or stirring or combinations thereof.

Liposomes are microscopic vesicles having a lipid wall comprising a lipid bilayer and can be used as drug delivery systems herein as well. Generally liposome formulations are preferred for poorly soluble or insoluble pharmaceutical agents. Liposomal preparations for use in the instant invention include cationic positively charged anionic negatively charged and neutral preparations.

The formulations may also contain irritation mitigating additives to minimize or eliminate the possibility of skin irritation or skin damage resulting from any of the components of the formulation. Suitable irritation mitigating additives include for example tocopherol monoamine oxidase inhibitors particularly phenyl alcohols such as 2 phenyl 1 ethanol glycerin salicylic acids and salicylates ascorbic acids and ascorbates ionophores such as monensin amphiphilic amines ammonium chloride N acetylcysteine cis urocanic acid capsaicin and chloroquine. The irritant mitigating additive if present may be incorporated into the present formulations at a concentration effective to mitigate irritation or skin damage typically representing not more than about 20 wt. more typically not more than about 5 wt. of the formulation.
