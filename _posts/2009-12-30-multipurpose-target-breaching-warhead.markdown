title: Multipurpose target breaching warhead
abstract: A single multipurpose ammunition projectile/warhead is provided, which has the capability of clearing a variety of different types of hardened targets. The single projectile of this invention may be used for breaching steel reinforced concrete walls; may be used against light armor targets; may be used for defeating bunkers; and may also be used for antipersonnel applications. Huge savings in time, money, inventory and logistics are realized through utilizing only this one multipurpose ammunition against all these types of targets. This multipurpose projectile, among other superb capabilities, is able to puncture an eight inch double steel reinforced concrete wall timed to then have its warhead explode into fragments. This allows fragmentation in a more effective, nearly ideal direction. The projectile warhead of made of extremely thick walled 300M steel; with the projectile center of gravity to be located equidistant between a pair of bourrelets, for increased stability.

This invention relates to the field of ammunition for breaching a hardened target. There is a long felt need for more effective warheads to breach such targets and especially a need to have a single projectile multipurpose in nature for clearing a variety of different types of targets. Current targets each require a specialized projectile. For example presently an M830A1 round may be used for breaching steel reinforced concrete walls an M1028 round may be used against light armor targets an M830 round may be used for defeating bunkers and an M908 round may be used for antipersonnel applications. Clearly if a single projectile could effectively be used for any of these type of targets huge savings in time money and logistics could be realized.

In striking a target barrier wall of steel double reinforced concrete perhaps 8 inches thick many current projectiles are not able to penetrate very deeply. Most current projectiles launched against such barriers flatten out before being able to penetrate then explode and the projectile warhead breaks into fragments. Although some warhead fragments will penetrate forward into the barrier as intended yet many fragments will not and only be deflected off the barrier. Although the flattening may create a larger area of surface impact the desired effect of clearing the target obstacle from its path isn t necessarily optimized. In most cases the warhead actually fragments in the opposite direction of the course of the projectile away from the target and the barrier does not receive the full effect of the explosive energy. What is needed is a projectile that is able to penetrate comparatively deep into a concrete barrier before exploding with resulting fragments thereof all penetrating into the target. A projectile is described in this invention which is capable of puncturing a double reinforced concrete wall projectile essentially fully intact and only then to have its warhead explode into fragments. This allows fragmentation in a more effective nearly ideal direction.

It is an object of the present invention to provide an extremely more effective projectile and warhead to breach double steel reinforced concrete barriers and 

It is a further object of the present invention to also provide an effective projectile and warhead to breach other hardened targets such as bunkers light armor and antipersonnel applications and 

It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a multipurpose projectile and warhead to breach all of double steel reinforced concrete barriers bunkers light armor and antipersonnel applications all with a single projectile and 

It is a yet another object of the present invention to provide logistical and other savings by providing a single multipurpose projectile for use against a variety of hardened targets including but not limited to double steel reinforced concrete barriers bunkers light armor and antipersonnel applications.

These and other objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent in view of the within detailed descriptions of the invention and in light of the following drawings. It should be understood that the sizes and shapes of the different components in the figures may not be in exact proportion and are shown here for visual clarity and for purpose of explanation.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
