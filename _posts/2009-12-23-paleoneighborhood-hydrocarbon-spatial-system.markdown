title: Paleoneighborhood hydrocarbon spatial system
abstract: A paleogeographic search system is provided for locating geoscience data relevant to a geographic search aperture. The paleogeographic search system comprises a geodatabase, an interface, a paleogeographic reconstruction engine, and a host processor. The paleogeographic engine is configured to transform the geographic search aperture according to tectonic plate movements to a transformed search aperture that the geographic search aperture occupied in a geological age of interest. The host processor is configured to apply a paleoaugmented geographic search aperture to a geodatabase for additional oil exploration data relevant to the geographic search aperture today. The paleoaugmented geographic search aperture is defined by augmenting the transformed search aperture to include relevant proximal locations for the selected geological age of interest to create an augmented transformed search area; and transforming the augmented transformed search aperture, according to tectonic plate movements, to the paleoaugmented geographic search aperture in present day world geography.
