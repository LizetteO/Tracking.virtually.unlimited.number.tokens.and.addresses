This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 108 428 filed Oct. 24 2008 the entire contents of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference without disclaimer.

This invention relates to health related data analysis and more particularly relates to an apparatus system and method for rapid cohort analysis.

Most corporations including health insurance corporations maintain a high volume of data. Such data may be analyzed and exploited for valuable information regarding business trends and other important statistics. Data mining is a common strategy for identifying and analyzing such data.

There are many various forms of data mining. Custom analytic operations may be developed to meet specific needs. Alternatively commercially available statistical analysis tools such as Statistical Analysis Software SAS may be used to identify statistical trends in data.

Health insurance companies typically maintain databases of health insurance claim information demographic information and other data about health insurance plan members. Such information may be used to gain valuable insights into disease causes progressions and potential cures. Unfortunately typical methods for analyzing such data are often cumbersome costly and require unworkably high processing times and resources.

The referenced shortcomings are not intended to be exhaustive but rather are among many that tend to impair the effectiveness of previously known techniques disease management however those mentioned here are sufficient to demonstrate that the methodologies appearing in the art have not been satisfactory and that a significant need exists for the techniques described and claimed in this disclosure.

From the foregoing discussion it should be apparent that a need exists for an apparatus system and method for rapid cohort analysis.

An apparatus for rapid cohort analysis is presented. In one embodiment the apparatus includes an interface and a processor. The interface may receive an identifier of a first index attribute. The processor may search the database for a first group of records associated with the first index attribute search the database for a second group of records each record in the second group of records sharing a common second index attribute with a record in the first group of records but not associated with the first index attribute and calculate a statistic in response to information associated with the first group of records and the second group of records.

A system is also presented for rapid cohort analysis. In one embodiment the system includes a data storage device configured to store a database comprising one or more records each record having one or more attributes. The system may also include a server in data communication with the data storage device.

In one embodiment the server may narrow the first group of records according to a limiting criterion. In a further embodiment the server may assign a first distinguishing identifier to each record in a subset of the first group of records in response to a determination that the subset of records have a common value for the second index attribute. The server may also assign a second distinguishing identifier to a record in the second group of records that corresponds to the first distinguishing identifier assigned to a record in the subset of the first group of records.

In one embodiment the server may count distinct records in the first group of records and the second group of records. The server may also aggregate records from the first group and from the second group according to a selected attribute. In still another embodiment the server may compute a probability in response to a ratio of a number of records in the first group having the selected attribute and a number of records in the second group having the selected attribute.

The present embodiments are not limited to the architecture of system . Rather the computer system is provided as an example of one type of computing device that may be adapted to perform the functions of server and or the user interface device . For example any suitable processor based device may be utilized including without limitation including personal data assistants PDAs computer game consoles and multi processor servers. Moreover the present embodiments may be implemented on application specific integrated circuits ASIC or very large scale integrated VLSI circuits. In fact persons of ordinary skill in the art may utilize any number of suitable structures capable of executing logical operations according to the described embodiments.

The network based system may include components or devices configured to operate in various network layers. For example the server may include modules configured to work within an application layer a presentation layer a data access layer and a metadata layer . In a further embodiment the server may access one or more data sets that comprises a data layer or data tier . For example a first data set a second data set and a third data set may comprise data tier that is stored on one or more data storage devices .

One or more web applications may operate in the application layer . For example a user may interact with the web application though one or more I O interfaces configured to interface with the web application through an I O adapter that operates on the application layer. In one particular embodiment a web application may be provided for rapid cohort analysis that includes software modules configured to perform the steps of receiving an identifier of a first index attribute searching a database for a first group of records associated with the first index attribute searching the database for a second group of records each record in the second group of records sharing a common second index attribute with a record in the first group of records but not associated with the first index attribute and calculating a statistic in response to information associated with the first group of records and the second group of records.

In a further embodiment the server may include components devices hardware modules or software modules configured to operate in the presentation layer to support one or more web services . For example a web application may access a web service to perform one or more web based functions for the web application . In one embodiment a web application may operate on a first server and access one or more web services hosted on a second server not shown during operation.

For example a web application for identifying cohorts and or analyzing cohort data or other information may access a first web service for identifying a first group of individuals associated with a first index attribute and a second web service for identifying a second group of individuals that share one or more second index attributes but are not associated with the first index attribute. The web services may receive an indicant of the first index attribute. In response the web service may return a list of records associated with the index attribute statistics graphs or the like. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize various web based architectures employing web services for modular operation of a web application .

In one embodiment a web application or a web service may access one or more of the data sets through the data access layer . In certain embodiments the data access layer may be divided into one or more independent data access layers for accessing individual data sets in the data tier . These individual data access layers may be referred to as data sockets or adapters. The data access layers may utilize metadata from the metadata layer to provide the web application or the web service with specific access to the data set .

For example the data access layer may include operations for performing a query of the data sets to retrieve specific information for the web application or the web service . In a more specific example the data access layer may include a query for records associated with individuals who have been diagnosed with diabetes or that are associated with an ICD 9 code associated with a diagnosis of diabetes.

In one embodiment the system may include one or more servers configured to host a software application for rapid cohort analysis or one or more web services for performing certain functions associated with rapid cohort analysis. The system may further comprise a user interface server configured to host an application or web page configured to allow a user to interact with the web application or web services for rapid cohort analysis. In such an embodiment a service provider may provide hardware and services or applications for use by a client without directly interacting with the client s customers.

In one embodiment the processor may include one or more software defined modules configured to search the database for a first group of records associated with the first index attribute search the database for a second group of records each record in the second group of records sharing a common second index attribute with a record in the first group of records but not associated with the first index attribute and calculate a statistic in response to information associated with the first group of records and the second group of records. In one embodiment these modules may include a first search module a second search module and a calculation module .

The first index attribute and the second index attribute may in certain circumstances include a plurality of index attributes. This may be referred to as an index signature. For example it may be helpful for a user of the present apparatus system and method to identify occurrences of a particular combination of diagnoses events characteristics or the like. In such an example a physician may desire to know the number of males over the age of 40 who have both diabetes and renal failure. Thus the first index attribute in this example may include the diagnosis code for diabetes as well as a diagnosis code for renal failure an age attribute having a value over 40 and a gender attribute having a value of male. Similarly the second index attribute may include a combination of a plurality of attributes field values characteristics or variables. In certain aspects the first group of records and the second group of records may differ in one index attribute the first index attribute such as a diagnosis of disease but can share a combination of attributes the second index attributes such as age gender area minority status income level etc.

In a further example the first and second attributes may include a temporal component. For example the first index attribute may include a temporal difference between two attributes. In such an embodiment the trigger for the first index attribute would include the combination of two attributes separated by a specified time frame. In such an example the first group of records may include all diabetics with a retinopathy within 1 year of diabetic onset which could be either an ICD9 code or a lab reading or both with another set of attribute of interest aggregated 1 to 5 years after the first retinopathy diagnosis. The second group of records the cohort group may include the entire patient population or could be limited to diabetics of the desired enrollment span who have not had a retinopathy.

Although the various functions of the server and the processor are described in the context of modules the methods processes and software described herein are not limited to a modular structure. Rather some or all of the functions described in relation to the modules of may be implemented in various formats including but not limited to a single set of integrated instructions commands code queries etc. In one embodiment the functions may be implemented in database query instructions including SQL PLSQL or the like. Alternatively the functions may be implemented in software coded in C C C php Java or the like. In still another embodiment the functions may be implemented in web based instructions including HTML XML etc.

Generally the interface module may receive user inputs and display user outputs. For example the interface module may receive an identifier of a first index attribute. The interface module may further receive identifiers of one or more second index attributes limiting criterion and other user inputs. In a further embodiment the interface module may display cohort analysis results. Such cohort analysis results may include statistics tables charts graphs recommendations and the like.

Structurally the interface module may include one or more of an I O adapter a communications adapter a user interface adapter and or a display adapter . The interface module may further include I O ports pins pads wires busses and the like for facilitating communications between the processor and the various adapters and interface components . The interface module may also include software defined components for interfacing with other software modules on the processor .

In one embodiment the processor may load and execute software modules configured to search the database for a first group of records associated with the first index attribute search the database for a second group of records each record in the second group of records sharing a common second index attribute with a record in the first group of records but not associated with the first index attribute and calculate a statistic in response to information associated with the first group of records and the second group of records. These software modules may include a first search module a second search module and a calculation module .

In a specific embodiment the processor may load and execute computer software configured to generate retrieve send or otherwise operate SQL instructions. For example the first search module may communicate a first SQL query to the data storage device which is configured to search the database for a first group of records associated with the first index attribute. The first index attribute may include a field value such as a healthcare billing or diagnosis code stored in a database of healthcare insurance information. In a specific embodiment the first search operation may identify a first group of individuals having records that include a specified ICD 9 diagnosis code. For example the first search may identify a first group of records in the database associated with individuals that have been diagnosed with diabetes.

The second search module may generate and or communicate a second SQL query to the database in response to the results of the first SQL query. The second query may be configured to search the database for a second group of records each record in the second group of records sharing a common second index attribute with a record in the first group of records but not associated with the first index attribute. The second group of records may be cohorts of the first group of records. The second index attribute may include a separate field of data values stored in the records. For example the second index attribute may include a field value that indicates certain specified characteristics of the individuals associated with the records such as age gender minority status a geographic feature lab tests lab results other diseases or diagnoses use of medication a genetic feature presence or absence of a genetic marker such as single nucleotide polymorphism a specific genotype a specific gene or gene cluster a characteristic of a specific chromosome and the like or a combination thereof.

By way of example the first search module may identify a first group of individuals that have been diagnosed with diabetes or some other illness based on an ICD 9 field value associated with such a medical diagnosis. The second search module may then identify cohorts for each individual or record identified by the first search. The cohorts may share one or more common second index attributes with the individuals or records identified in the first group such as age gender or the like however the cohorts would not include the first index attribute. In this example the cohorts may be the same age and gender as the individuals in the first group but not have been diagnosed with diabetes.

In certain embodiments for each record identified in the first group the second search module may identify one or more cohorts for example at least or about 2 5 10 50 100 200 cohorts or any range derivable therein with a difference in the first index attribute but a matching second index attribute. For example for each record associated with a diabetic subject 100 non diabetic cohorts may be identified for a match of age and gender. This aspect may reduce the noise in cohort matching and measurement of attributes to compare between matching records in the second group primary and the first group cohort by over sampling.

In further embodiments the cohort group can be sampled in a deterministic or random way by altering the analytic function of the second search module . For example as shown in the SQL instructions described later the cohort group may be sampled randomly based on internal data access with specific instructions like 

In another embodiment the second search module may identify the cohort group of records by forcing randomness into the cohort group as exemplified by the instructions like 

In a further aspects the sampling of the cohort group may be performed in a deterministic manner with predetermined individuals as matching cohorts with exemplary instructions like 

In a further embodiment the first search module and the second search module may be integrated into a single search module. Specifically a single set of SQL instructions may be used to both identify the first group of records and identify the cohorts. The benefits of this embodiment may include reduced system overhead reduced search and analysis time reduced labor for configuration and generation of queries etc. For example with a single integrated SQL query a user may be able to obtain results for analysis in far less time than he she might otherwise expect. Such an embodiment would not require separate analysis and generation of separate queries for the first group and the second group. Consequently a significant time savings may be realized.

In one embodiment the calculation module may calculate a statistic in response to information associated with the first group of records and the second group of records. For example the calculation module may include analogue or digital logic firmware or software configured to carry out one or more calculations according to one or more predefined logic functions. In a further embodiment the processor may include a software defined calculation module configured to perform analysis and calculation of statistics in response to the information and data retrieved from the database for the first group of records and the associated second group of cohort records.

In a specific embodiment the first search module and the second search module may feed retrieved data into a spreadsheet configured to perform one or more calculations on the data. For example an Excel spreadsheet may include one or more embedded functions or operations configured to calculate statistics such as averages odds ratios and other probabilities counts summations and the like. The data may be automatically imported into a spreadsheet using a macro a software based script or the like. In an alternative embodiment the calculation module may include hard coded or dynamically variable software functions for calculating such statistics and generating results for a user.

In a further embodiment the narrow module may narrow the first group of records according to a limiting criterion. The narrow module may narrow the first group of records by restricting search parameters before the first search is performed. Alternatively the narrow module may filter remove or otherwise delete the search results according to the limiting criterion. In a certain embodiment multiple limiting criteria may be used to restrict the scope of the returned search results. In one embodiment a limiting criteria may include a field value such as record date age gender or the like.

In one embodiment the server may assign a first distinguishing identifier to each record in a subset of the first group of records in response to a determination that the subset of records have a common value for the second index attribute. For example the processor may include a first assignment module configured to assign the first distinguishing identifier to the records. In an alternative embodiment an SQL command generated by the server or stored in RAM or on the data storage device may include instructions that when executed by a storage controller or the processor on the server may cause the first distinguishing identifier to be assigned to each of the matching records. In such an example the SQL code may include instructions to search the database for records associated with a diagnosis code indicating diabetes or some other illness. If multiple search results have matching second index attributes such as age gender or the like the SQL instructions may include an operation to assign an incremental distinguishing identifier such as a 1 2 or 3 to each of the records in the subset of records having common second index attributes.

Similarly the server may assign a second distinguishing identifier to a record in the second group of records that corresponds to the first distinguishing identifier assigned to a record in the subset of the first group of records. This operation may be performed in similar ways as those described above with relation to the first distinguishing identifier. Specifically a second assignment module may make the assignment. Alternatively an SQL operation embedded with the search may perform the assignment.

In one embodiment the server may include a count module configured to count distinct records in the first group of records and the second group of records. The counting function may be implemented using a hardware based counter. Alternatively the counting function may be implemented in software. In a specific embodiment the processor may execute SQL instructions configured to provide the record count in response to search or query results. In such an embodiment the counting function may be integrated with the search and assignment instructions into a single set of SQL commands or instructions.

In one embodiment the server may include an aggregation module configured to aggregate records from the first group and from the second group according to a selected attribute. For example the selected attribute shared between the first and the second group may be a temporal index date such as a start date of certain event or occurrence e.g. diagnosis treatment drug administration procedures lab tests or the like. In certain embodiments the temporal index date may be set by an event for each record primary in the first group e.g. onset date of diabetes or insertion of a pacemaker and set in an arbitrary manner for each matching record cohort in the second group e.g. the same event date for each primary cohort pair when the cohort in the second group is the same age as the primary . In other embodiments the temporal index date may be set by an event for each record in the first group e.g. onset date of diabetes administration of a drug perform a treatment or procedure or insertion of a pacemaker and may be set in a determined manner in the second group e.g. the time the cohort shared a similar but different event such as administration of a different drug onset of a related but different treatment or procedure or insertion of a different pacemaker brand . The index date could be seconds hours years or a combination thereof etc depending on the event.

In certain embodiments after determination of the index date for each record the first and second groups of records may be aggregated respectively on the relatively same time frame for comparison as further illustrated in .

The server may also include other modules for computing formatting and otherwise producing statistics including a compute module and a graph module . The compute module may compute a probability in response to a ratio of a number of records in the first group having the selected attribute and a number of records in the second group having the selected attribute. The graph may generate format and provide a graphical representation of the statistics. These modules may be stand alone modules implemented in hardware firmware or software. Alternatively the functions may be accomplished through commercial calculation products or spreadsheets or software or SQL instructions that are integrated with the other functions of the server . In a specific embodiment the calculation module including some or all of its component modules may communicate the statistics with the interface module for display or communication to a user.

The schematic flow chart diagrams that follow are generally set forth as logical flow chart diagrams. As such the depicted order and labeled steps are indicative of one embodiment of the presented method. Other steps and methods may be conceived that are equivalent in function logic or effect to one or more steps or portions thereof of the illustrated method. Additionally the format and symbols employed are provided to explain the logical steps of the method and are understood not to limit the scope of the method. Although various arrow types and line types may be employed in the flow chart diagrams they are understood not to limit the scope of the corresponding method. Indeed some arrows or other connectors may be used to indicate only the logical flow of the method. For instance an arrow may indicate a waiting or monitoring period of unspecified duration between enumerated steps of the depicted method. Additionally the order in which a particular method occurs may or may not strictly adhere to the order of the corresponding steps shown.

The processor may then issue a command to search the database for a second group of records. Each record in the second group of records may share a common second index attribute which could be one or more common attributes with a record in the first group of records but not include the first index attribute. For example SQL query issued by the processor may also include a query statement to search for a second group of individuals each individual having the same age and or gender as an individual identified in the first group but not having the diabetes diagnosis code in their record. These individuals in the second group may be considered cohorts of the individuals in the first group of records.

The server may then receive the results from the database searches . The calculation module may then calculate a statistic in response to the information associated with the first group of records and the second group of records. For example a spreadsheet program may calculate probabilities of being diagnosed with diabetes in the presence of certain identified lab values other diagnoses physical conditions healthcare patterns weight age gender etc. The statistics may include averages probabilities and other computational products including identification of trends and commonalities among the records.

Limiting criterion may include windowing values configured to limit or restrict the time frames from which records will be searched restrictions on minimum enrollment time minimum number of records gender restrictions age restrictions and other similar threshold and limiting values. The narrowing module may incorporate the limiting criterion into a query used to search the database for the first group of records associated with the first index attribute. For example the query may search for all records associated with individuals that have been diagnosed with diabetes but the query may be restricted to return only results associated with individuals that have at least two years worth of records in the database.

If the first assignment module determined that multiple records within the first group of records have common second index attributes the first assignment module may assign a distinguishing identifier to each matching record. The second search module may then search the database for cohorts of each record in the first group. If it had been determined that multiple records in the first group of records had common second index attributes the second assignment module may assign a distinguishing identifier to each of the cohort records in the second group of records that correspond to a distinguished record in the first group of records. In such an embodiment the second search module may identify a cohort for each record in the first group of records.

In one embodiment the aggregation module may aggregate records from the first group and from the second group according to a selected attribute. An example of aggregation is illustrated in . The compute module may then compute an odds ratio. In an alternative embodiment the compute module may compute an average or some other mathematical statistic. In certain further embodiments the count module may produce a count of records having a selected characteristic as shown in . In still a further embodiment the graph module may generate one or more graphs to graphically display one or more statistics calculated by the server .

In a specific example the server may send a single set of SQL instruction to perform the first search assign distinguishing identifiers perform the second search and other searching functions. In a further embodiment the SQL instructions may further include instructions for aggregating the records. In still another embodiment the same set of SQL instructions may include functions for computing statistics such as the odds ratio of a specified event or occurrence within the records. For example one embodiment of SQL instructions that may be used to perform the method of may include 

The embodiment of the table described in illustrates one method for calculating and displaying statistics. In this embodiment a first group of records may be collected for individuals having been diagnosed with diabetes. In such an embodiment the diagnosis code for diabetes may be the first index attribute. The second group of individuals cohorts of the individuals in the first group may be collected. The cohorts may have the same age gender or some other second index attribute. The number of individuals or records identified in the searches may be limited by limiting criterion. The results may then be aggregated and statistics may be calculated for one or more selected attributes. For example in the table of the selected attributes are diagnosis codes for potential co morbid conditions.

The limiting criteria may also include an aggregation window or time frame for collecting records associated with the individual. The aggregation window variable may include a time frame before or after the occurrence of the first index attribute from which to collect records. For example the narrow module may only collect records for two years prior to the occurrence of the diagnosis code and for ninety days after the occurrence of the diagnosis code.
