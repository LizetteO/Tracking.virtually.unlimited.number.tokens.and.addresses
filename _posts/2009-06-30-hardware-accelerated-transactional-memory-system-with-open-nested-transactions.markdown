title: Hardware accelerated transactional memory system with open nested transactions
abstract: Hardware assisted transactional memory system with open nested transactions. Embodiments include a system whereby hardware acceleration of transactions can be accomplished by implementing open nested transaction in hardware which respect software locks such that a top level transaction can be implemented in software, and thus not be limited by hardware constraints typical when using hardware transactional memory systems.
