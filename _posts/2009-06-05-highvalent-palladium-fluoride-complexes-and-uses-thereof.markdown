No. 61 059 142 filed Jun. 5 2008 the entire contents of which is incorporated by reference.

The regioselective fluorination of organic compounds is an important challenge in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals see for example Muller et al. 2007 317 1881 1886 Park et al. 2001 41 443 470 Bohm et al. 2004 5 637 643 and Jeschke 2004 5 570 589 .

Syntheses of simple fluoroarenes currently rely on the pyrolysis of diazonium tetrafluoroborates Balz G. Schiemann G. 1927 60 1186 1190 direct fluorination using highly reactive elemental fluorine Sandford J. 2007 128 90 104 or nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions of electron poor aromatic systems by displacement of other halogens or nitro groups Sun et al. 2006 45 2720 2725 Adams et al. 1999 28 225 231 . The reductive elimination of arylfluorides from palladium II fluoride complexes is an attractive potential alternative that has been investigated by Grushin Grushin 2002 8 1006 1014 over the past decade and more recently by Yandulov. A single substrate p fluoronitrobenzene has been prepared successfully in 10 yield in the Yandulov study from a stoichiometric palladium fluoride complex Yandulov et al. 2007 129 1342 1358 . Directed electrophilic fluorination of phenylpyridine derivatives and related structures using catalytic palladium II acetate and N fluoropyridinium salts has been reported by Sanford in 2006 Hull et al. 2006 128 7134 7135 . Taking advantage of the directing effect of a pyridine substituent proximal carbon hydrogen bonds can be fluorinated using microwave irradiation at high temperatures 100 150 C. 1 4 h 33 75 yield . However the fact that there is an absence in the literature of any general functional group tolerant fluorination reaction methodology reflects the difficulty of forming carbon fluorine bonds.

The use of F labelled organic compounds for positron emission tomography PET requires the controlled efficient introduction of fluorine into functionalized molecules see for example Couturier et al. 2004 31 1182 1206 Lasne et al. Chemistry of beta emitting compounds based on fluorine 18 In 2002 Vol. 222 pp 201 258 and Phelps 2000 97 9226 9233 . PET has been used to measure presynaptic accumulation of F fluorodopa tracer in the dopaminergic regions of the brain see for example Ernst et al. Presynaptic Dopaminergic Deficits in Lesch Nyhan Disease 1996 334 1568 1572 but fluorination of other organic compounds has been difficult due to lack of an appropriate fluorination method.

Despite the utility of fluorinated organic compounds in multiple pharmaceutical diagnostic and agrochemical applications C F bond formation remains a challenging organic transformation with no broadly applicable solutions.

While high valent palladium complexes may be intermediates in the transformations described above none have been reported to date. Although discrete high valent palladium fluorides are potential intermediates electrophilic palladium carbon bond cleavage is a mechanistic alternative which has not been ruled out. While hundreds of early transition metal fluorides have been structurally characterized Murphy et al. 97 3425 3468 1997 which is incorporated herein by reference only eight palladium complexes with terminal fluoride ligands can be found in the Cambridge Structural Database none of which contain a palladium center in an oxidation state other than 2 Fraser et al. 119 4769 4770 1997 Marshall et al. 17 5427 5430 1998 Roe et al. 19 4575 4582 2000 Grushin et al. 41 4476 4479 2002 Yahav et al. 125 13634 13635 2003 Jasim et al. 23 6140 6149 2004 each of which is incorporated herein by reference .

The present invention provides novel high valent palladium fluoride complexes and method of using these complexes in the fluorination of organic compounds. The inventive system is particularly useful in preparing F labeled compounds for PET imaging. The complexes are typically palladium IV fluoride complexes as described herein. The complexes include two fixed ligands that stabilize the high valent palladium complex. In certain embodiments one of the ligands is a bidentate ligand and the other ligand is a tridentate ligand. The inventive system was envisioned due to the limited nature of nucleophilic F chemistry. The inventive system relies on the transfer of electrophilic F which is analogous to the commercially available fluorinating reagent Selectflour N chloromethyl N fluorotriethylenediammonium bis tetrafluoroborate .

As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable salt refers to those salts which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity irritation allergic response and the like and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example S. M. Berge et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences 1977 66 1 19 incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid phosphoric acid sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid oxalic acid maleic acid tartaric acid citric acid succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange.

As used herein the term prodrug refers to a derivative of a parent compound that requires transformation within the body in order to release the parent compound. In certain cases a prodrug has improved physical and or delivery properties over the parent compound. Prodrugs are typically designed to enhance pharmaceutically and or pharmacokinetically based properties associated with the parent compound. The advantage of a prodrug can lie in its physical properties such as enhanced water solubility for parenteral administration at physiological pH compared to the parent compound or it enhances absorption from the digestive tract or it may enhance drug stability for long term storage. The compounds of the invention readily undergo dehydration to form oligomeric anhydrides by dehydration of the boronic acid moiety to form dimers trimers and tetramers and mixtures thereof. These oligomeric species hydrolyze under physiological conditions to reform the boronic acid. As such the oligomeric anhydrides are contemplated as a prodrug of the compounds of the present invention and may be used in the treatment of disorder and or conditions a wherein the inhibition of FAAH provides a therapeutic effect.

As used herein the term isomers includes any and all geometric isomers and stereoisomers. For example isomers include cis and trans isomers E and Z isomers R and S enantiomers diastereomers D isomers L isomers racemic mixtures thereof and other mixtures thereof as falling within the scope of the invention. For instance an isomer enantiomer may in some embodiments be provided substantially free of the corresponding enantiomer and may also be referred to as optically enriched. Optically enriched as used herein means that the compound is made up of a significantly greater proportion of one enantiomer. In certain embodiments the compound of the present invention is made up of at least about 90 by weight of a preferred enantiomer. In other embodiments the compound is made up of at least about 95 98 or 99 by weight of a preferred enantiomer. Preferred enantiomers may be isolated from racemic mixtures by any method known to those skilled in the art including chiral high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC and the formation and crystallization of chiral salts or prepared by asymmetric syntheses. See for example Jacques et al. Wiley Interscience New York 1981 Wilen S. H. et al. 33 2725 1977 Eliel E. L. McGraw Hill N.Y. 1962 Wilen S. H. p. 268 E. L. Eliel Ed. Univ. of Notre Dame Press Notre Dame Ind. 1972 .

As used herein polymorph refers to a crystalline complex or compound existing in more than one crystalline form structure. When polymorphism exists as a result of difference in crystal packing it is called packing polymorphism. Polymorphism can also result from the existence of different conformers of the same molecule in conformational polymorphism. In pseudopolymorphism the different crystal types are the result of hydration or solvation.

The present invention provides novel high valent palladium fluoride complexes. The complexes have terminal fluoride ligands and the palladium center has an oxidation state greater than 2. In certain embodiments the palladium center has an oxidation state of 4.

The ligands surrounding the complex stabilize the octahedral coordination sphere thus disfavoring reductive elimination and other reductive pathways. These complexes are useful in transferring a eletrophilic F to an organic compound. In particular the inventive complexes are useful in labelling a compound with F for positron emission tomography PET . Also described herein are compositions reaction mixtures and kits comprising the palladium complexes. Also described herein are methods for fluorinating organic compounds using a palladium complex e.g. a palladium complex described herein.

The present invention provides novel high valent palladium fluoride complexes. In certain embodiments the complex is a Pd IV complex. Typically the complex comprises one or more bidentate or tridentate ligands. Such ligands particularly scorpionate ligands are thought to stabilize the octahedral coordination sphere of the palladium IV center and thus prevent reductive elimination or other reductive pathways from an octahedral dpalladium IV to a square planar dpalladium II .

The inventive high valent palladium IV fluoride complexes may also be prepared using nucleophilic fluoride rather than electrophilic fluorinating reagent. In general this may be accomplished by first preparing the analogous high valent palladium IV chloride or other halogen complex and subjecting the complex to halogen metathesis using AgF as shown in the scheme below.

Oxidation of the palladium II intermediate with PhIClaffords the Pd IV chloride complex. Reaction of the Pd IV chloride complex with AgF under suitable conditions then yields the Pd IV fluoride complex.

The inventive high valent palladium IV fluoride complexes possess an electrophilic fluoride and thus are reactive toward nucleophiles such as palladium II complexes e.g. palladium II aryl complexes PPh enamines and enol silyl ethers. Although electrophilic fluorinating reagents including acetyl hypofluorites xenon difluoride and nitrogen fluorides are commercially available they are expensive and tend to be poorly regioselective. The inventive complexes may also be useful in fluorination reactions by providing electrophilic F. In particular the high valent palladium complexes may be useful in conjunction with other transition metal reagents or catalysts for transferring the electrophilic F to an organic compound.

In certain embodiments the inventive high valent palladium fluoride complexes described herein are used in conjunction with the palladium II mediated fluorination reactions described in U.S. provisional patent application U.S. Ser. No. 61 063 096 filed Jan. 31 2008 and U.S. Ser. No. 61 050 446 filed May 5 2008. Such reactions are particularly useful in preparing aryl fluorides.

The present invention provides a process for fluorination of organic compounds and as such has many useful applications. In certain embodiments the fluorination reaction is regiospecific.

Introduction of fluorine into a certain position of bioactive compound such as a pharmaceutical agent and an agricultural chemical may remarkably reduce the toxicity of the compound. This is due to the mimic and blocking effect characterized by fluorine. Many compounds such as 5 fluorouracil have been reported as successful examples.

Attempts to efficiently synthesize fluorine containing compounds are performed in many fields. Methods to introduce fluorine into a certain position through the use of fluorinating agents or the use of fluorine containing building blocks have been reported see for example Liu et al. . 1981 103 7195 Lovey et al. . 1982 25 71 and Kikuchi et al. 1997 55 88 .

Organofluorine compounds are emerging as chemical specialties of significant and increasing commercial interest. A major driver has been the development of fluorine containing bio active molecules for use as medicinal and plant protection agents. Other new applications involving organofluorine chemistry are in the synthesis of liquid crystals surface active agents specialty coatings reactive dyes and even olefin polymerization catalysts.

A commonly used PET tracer is 2 deoxy 2 fluoroglucose FDG which behaves like glucose in the body and is transported to sites of high metabolism such as cancer cells. FDG is not itself metabolized and therefore accumulates in cancer tissues which in turn can be visualized. The non invasive nature and the high sensitivity render PET a powerful method for early cancer identification using FDG.

The F radioisotope has a half life of 109 minutes. The short half life dictates restrictions on chemical synthesis of PET tracers because introduction of the fluorine atom has to take place at a very late stage of the synthesis to avoid the unproductive decay of F before it is injected into the body. Fluoride ion is the most common reagent to introduce F but the specific chemical properties of the fluoride ion currently limit the available pool of PET tracers. Due to the narrow functional group compatibility of the strongly basic fluoride ion only a limited set of chemical reactions can be employed for fluorination and hence the synthesis of PET tracers is limited to fairly simple molecules such as FDG. The field of PET imaging would benefit from the availability of a new method that is capable of introducing radiolabeled fluoride into structurally more complex organic molecules. An easy access to drug based PET tracers would simplify determining the fate of such drugs in the body and thereby help to identify and understand their mode of action bioavailability and time dependent biodistribution.

High valent palladium fluorides are potential intermediates and reagents for the synthesis of aryl fluorides which are important as pharmaceuticals and as tracers for positron emission tomography M ller K.

In Contrast Agents II 2002 Vol. 222 pp 201 258 each of which is incorporated herein by reference . We have recently reported the palladium mediated fluorination of arylboronic acids to form functionalized fluoroarenes and speculated on the intermediacy of discrete high valent palladium fluorides. High valent palladium fluoride complexes have also been suggested in other carbon fluorine bond formations. In 2006 Sanford published the palladium catalyzed fluorination of phenylpyridine derivatives and related substrates using electrophilic fluorination sources as oxidants under microwave irradiation at 100 150 C. Hull K. L. Anani W. Q. Sanford M. S. 2006 128 7134 7135 incorporated herein by reference . While high valent palladium complexes may be intermediates in this transformation none have been reported to date. In 2008 Vigalok and Vedernikov communicated the formation of fluorobenzene and iodobenzene in 10 and 90 yield respectively upon treatment of a diphosphine arylpalladium iodide with 1 fluoro 2 4 6 trimethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate Yahav Levi A. Goldberg I. Vigalok A. Vedernikov A. N. 2008 130 724 731 incorporated herein by reference . The transient formation of a palladium IV fluoride followed by either carbon iodine or carbon fluorine bond formation via reductive elimination is a potential mechanistic pathway that would explain the observed products. Although discrete high valent palladium fluorides are potential intermediates in all three examples Sanford s Vigalok s and our own electrophilic palladium carbon bond cleavage is a mechanistic alternative which has not been ruled out in any of these examples in no instance has a high valent palladium fluoride been observed. In 1992 Canty reported the reaction of a palladium IV bromide with silver I fluoride to presumably generate a benzyldimethylpalladium IV fluoride that was observed by H NMR Canty A. J. Traill P. R.

In this Example the synthesis of a well defined organometallic palladium IV fluoride and its characterization are described. To our knowledge no high valent palladium fluoride has previously been characterized by either F NMR or X ray crystallography. Three structural design elements were considered to synthesize a stable palladium IV fluoride. Firstly we targeted complexes containing a single carbon based ligand. Carbon based ligands are strong donors and can thus stabilize high valent palladium centers but the presence of multiple carbon based ligands can result in carbon carbon reductive elimination with concurrent reduction of the metal center Canty A. J. Traill P. R. Skelton B. W. White A. H. 1992 433 213 222 incorporated herein by reference . Similarly other X type ligands such as amido and alkoxide ligands can support high valent metal centers by both and donation but also participate in reductive elimination from palladium IV to form carbon X bonds Dick A. R. Kampf J. W. Sanford M. S. 2005 127 12790 12791 Pawlikowski A. V. Getty A. D. Goldberg K. I. 2007 129 10382 10393 each of which is incorporated herein by reference . Secondly neutral nitrogenous donors were selected because they are known to stabilize high valent metal centers and typically do not participate in reductive elimination Berry J. F. Bill E. Bothe E. George S. D. Mienert B. Neese F. Wieghardt K. 2006 312 1937 1941 incorporated herein by reference . Finally we envisioned rigid ligand scaffolds would stabilize the anticipated octahedral coordination sphere of palladium IV and thus disfavor reductive elimination and other reductive pathways from an octahedral dpalladium IV to a square planar dpalladium II C mpora J. Palma P. del Rio D. L pez J. A. lvarez E. Connelly N. G. 2005 24 3624 3628 incorporated herein by reference . Tetrapyrazolylborate Tp ligands position three neutral nitrogen donor atoms in a facial geometry for chelation to a transition metal Trofimenko S. 1967 89 3170 3177 Trofimenko S. 1971 4 17 22 Trofimenko S. 1993 93 943 980 each of which is incorporated herein by reference . The Tp ligand has been used in organometallic chemistry to stabilize octahedral complexes due to the three N Metal N bond angles near 90 . The N N dimethylaminonaphthyl ligand was selected because it can be installed on palladium by cyclometallation to form a rigid electron rich five membered chelate.

Cyclometallation of N N dimethyl 1 naphthylmethanamine 1 with disodium tetrachloropalladate afforded the palladium II chloride dimer 2 in 58 yield . The chloride ligands were subsequently substituted using one equivalent of potassium tetrapyrazolylborate per palladium to afford the palladium II borate 3 in 74 yield. Line broadening in the H and C NMR spectra of 3 at room temperature is consistent with previously observed dynamic coordination dissociation of the pyrazolyl ligands of the Tp ligand to palladium Onishi M. Ohama Y. Sugimura K. Hiraki K. 1976 955 958 incorporated herein by reference sharper resonances could be observed at 50 C. Oxidation of 3 with commercially available 1 fluoro pyridinium triflate 4 afforded a discrete new compound by H and F NMR. A F NMR fluorine resonance was observed at 287.4 ppm no other values for F NMR resonances of high valent palladium fluorides are available but F NMR shifts of palladium II fluorides have been reported in a range from 268 to 301 ppm Fraser S. L. Antipin M. Y. Khroustalyov V. N. Grushin V. V. 1997 119 4769 4770 Grushin V. V. Marshall W. J. 2006 128 12644 12645 each of which is incorporated herein by reference . Additionally the line broadening in the NMR spectra observed for 3 was not observed for the new compound 5. The palladium fluoride 5 was unstable toward water and when heated in an acetone solution to 50 C. purification isolation or structural characterization of 5 was not pursued.

The more stable palladium IV fluoride 7 could be prepared when using 1 fluoro 2 4 6 trimethylpyridinium hexafluorophosphate 6 an electrophilic fluorination reagent specifically prepared for this purpose eq 1 . The palladium IV fluoride complex 7 with a hexafluorophosphate counteranion is more stable than the palladium triflate 5. High valent palladium fluoride 7 is a moisture and air stable orange solid that can be stored in ambient atmosphere without decomposition for at least one week. The solution structure of 7 was characterized by five NMR active nuclei. Similar to the F NMR resonance observed for 5 a F NMR resonance for 7 is observed is at 294.0 ppm in addition to the hexafluorophosphate resonance at 72.7 ppm. The NMR data is consistent with a cationic octahedral palladium IV fluoride complex in which three of the four pyrazolyl substituents of the Tp ligand are complexed to palladium. A Jcoupling of 3.4 Hz from one benzyl hydrogen to the terminal fluoride in the H NMR of 7 was observed. In addition a coupling constant of 6.5 Hz was observed in the C NMR spectrum for one of the carbon atoms of the two amine methyl groups that we attribute to a Jcoupling. An H F HSQC NMR experiment was performed which both confirmed the Jcoupling and demonstrated the simultaneous coordination of the dimethylamino ligand and the fluoride ligand to palladium in solution.

To unambiguously establish the connectivity of 7 crystals suitable for X ray crystallographic analysis were obtained by cooling a solution of 7 that was heated at reflux in methylene chloride hexane benzene. The compound crystallized as orange yellow plates in the triclinic space group P . Disorder was observed only for the hexafluorophosphate counteranion which was treated with a two site disorder model P 1 F 2 F 3 F 4 F 5 F 6 F 7 and P 1 F 2 F 3 F 4 F 5 F 6 F 7 with refined site occupancy factors of 0.80 2 and 0.20 2 respectively. The disorder model was included in the least squares refinement with mild rigid bond similar U 1 2 and 1 3 distance restraints. The cationic palladium fragment of the complex was fully ordered. The solid state structure of 7 confirmed the solution structure as a palladium IV complex with a terminal fluoride ligand . The palladium fluorine bond distance is 1.923 4 which is the shortest palladium fluorine bond observed to date. The other bond lengths and angles are within the expected values of a doctahedral palladium IV complex supported by a Tp ligand.

In conclusion we report the synthesis and characterization of an organometallic palladium IV fluoride complex. The complex is stable to air and moisture and thermally stable to at least 60 C.

The compound was crystallized from a dichloromethane benzene hexape solution as orange yellow plates. A crystal 0.050 mm 0.075 mm 0.100 mm in size was selected mounted on a nylon loop with Paratone N oil and transferred to a Bruker SMART APEX II diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystems 700 Series Cryostream Cooler and Mo K radiation 0.71073 . A total of 1855 frames were collected at 193 2 K with an oscillation range of 0.5 frame and an exposure time of 30 s frame using the APEX2 suite of software. Bruker AXS 2006a Data were collected to 22.50 rather than the routine value of 27.50 because the crystal examined did not exhibit usable diffraction beyond 22.50 . Unit cell refinement on all observed reflections and data reduction with corrections for Lp and decay were performed using SAINT. Bruker AXS 2006b Scaling and a numerical absorption correction were done using SADABS. Bruker AXS 2004 The minimum and maximum transmission factors were 0.9237 and 0.9608 respectively. A total of 18585 reflections were collected 4559 were unique R 0.0763 and 3098 had I 2 I . The lack of systematic absences was consistent with the compound having crystallized in the triclinic space group P1 or P . The centrosymmetric space group P No. 2 was selected. The observed mean E 1 value was 0.867 versus the expectation values of 0.968 and 0.736 for centric and noncentric data respectively .

The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full matrix least squares on Fusing SHELXTL. Bruker AXS 2001 The asymmetric unit was found to contain one fluoro 1 dimethyl amino methylnaphthalenyl tetrapyrazoylborate palladium IV cation one hexafluorophosphate anion a half molecule of benzene and one dichloro methane. All of the nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement coefficients. The hydrogen atoms were assigned isotropic displacement coefficients U H 1.2 U C or 1.5 U C and their coordinates were allowed to ride on their respective carbons. The hexafluorophosphate anion was treated with a two site disorder model P 1 F 2 F 3 F 4 F 5 F 6 F 7 and P 1 F 2 F 3 F 4 F 5 F 6 F 7 with refined site occupany factors of 0.80 2 and 0.20 2 respectively and included in the least squares refinement with mild rigid bond similar U 1 2 and 1 3 distance restraints. The refinement converged to R F 0.0603 wR F 0.1534 and S 1.079 for 3098 reflections with I 2 I and R F 0.1011 wR F 0.1783 and S 1.079 for 4559 unique reflections 517 parameters and 252 restraints. The maximum in the final cycle of least squares was less than 0.001 and the residual peaks on the final difference Fourier map ranged from 0.864 to 1.312 e . Scattering factors were taken from the International Tables for Crystallography Volume C. Maslen et al. 1992 and Creagh McAuley 1992
