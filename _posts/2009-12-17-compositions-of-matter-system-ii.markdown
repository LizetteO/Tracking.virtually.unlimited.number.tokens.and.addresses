This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 063 694 filed Feb. 23 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 655 160 . The entire teachings of the above application are incorporated herein by reference.

According to modern quantum theory the chemical and physical properties of substances arise fundamentally from electrodynamic interactions. Modifying these interactions can alter electronic structures and thereby endow the elements of the periodic table and their compounds with new properties.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 572 792 which is incorporated herein by reference to Christopher J. Nagel describes a process for modifying the electronic structure of a material and of the products that are produced by the process. For example this patent describes metals such as copper cobalt nickel and alloys thereof that possess novel properties such as novel XRF patterns and magnetic properties. However it is desired to further amplify or modify the effects achieved by the process.

The present invention relates to improved methods of modifying the electronic structure of a material. The process includes the iterative and or cyclic addition of energy to a material.

In one embodiment the present invention includes a method of processing a metal or an alloy of metals comprising the steps of 

The process in a preferred embodiment involves one or more iterations or cycles of adding energy to a material in a supersaturated state with carbon. In this embodiment the process comprises or further comprises one or more of the steps in one or more iterations or cycles 

In one embodiment steps 8 and 9 or 9 and 11 are performed and repeated 1 2 3 4 or more times preferably 4 or more times.

In preferred embodiments the improvement in the processes of the invention comprises at least one of the following 

Advantages of the present invention include a method of processing metals into new compositions of matter and producing and characterizing compositions of matter with altered physical and or electrical properties.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 572 792 to Christopher J. Nagel describes a process for modifying the electronic structure of a material and to the products that are produced by the process. For example this patent which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety describes metals such as copper cobalt nickel and alloys thereof that are induced by the process to acquire novel properties such as novel XRF patterns and magnetic properties. As described in that patent electromagnetic chemistry is the science that affects the transfer and circulation of energy in many forms when induced by changes in electromagnetic energy. In empty space a constant speed for light independent of the frame of reference i.e. each ray of light moves in the coordinate system at rest with the definite velocity V independent of whether this ray of light is emitted by a body at rest or a body in uniform motion as advanced in The Theory of Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies Einstein 1905 implicitly embeds a discrete partition between its associated coordinate system at rest and the reference systems that are relative to it. A topological description of this partition satisfying the postulates advanced in the above referenced paper requires that when the electrodynamic components of matter are manipulated discrete changes in energy exchange occur between meromorphic constructions while continuous changes in energy exchange occur along holomorphic mappings. Harmonics governing the redistribution of energy are the vehicles by which changes in material properties such as the magnitude and or the orientation can occur. Alignment of the electrodynamic component induces effects that may result in significant changes in the underlying material species 1 alignment of atoms with the resulting directionality of physical properties 2 alignment of energy levels and the capability to modify harmonic structure may establish physical properties conducive for energy transfer 3 alignment of the electrodynamic component includes the opening of pathways for free electron flow and 4 alignment of electrodynamic field phase orientation.

The present invention relates to new materials and compositions of matter and includes manufactured or tailored metals or alloys of metals. A manufactured or tailored metal or alloy is a metal or alloy which exhibits a change in electronic structure such as that seen in a fluid or adjustable XRF spectrum. The American Heritage College Dictionary Third Edition defines fluid as changing or tending to change.

Metals of the present invention are generally p d or f block metals. Metals include transition metals such as Group 3 metals e.g. scandium yttrium lanthanum Group 4 metals e.g. titanium zirconium hafnium Group 5 metals vanadium niobium tantalum Group 6 metals e.g. chromium molybdenum tungsten Group 7 metals e.g. manganese technetium rhenium Group 8 metals e.g. iron ruthenium osmium Group 9 metals e.g. cobalt rhodium iridium Group 10 metals nickel palladium platinum Group 11 metals e.g. copper silver gold and Group 12 metals e.g. zinc cadmium mercury . Metals of the present invention also include alkali metals e.g. lithium sodium potassium rubidium and cesium and alkaline earth metals e.g. beryllium magnesium calcium strontium barium . Additional metals include aluminum gallium indium tin lead boron germanium arsenic antimony tellurium bismuth thallium polonium astatine and silicon.

The present invention also includes alloys of metals. Alloys are typically mixtures of metals. Alloys of the present invention can be formed for example by melting together two or more of the metals listed above. Preferred alloys include those comprised of copper gold and silver tin zinc and lead tin sodium magnesium and potassium iron vanadium chromium and manganese nickel tantalum hafnium and tungsten copper and ruthenium nickel and ruthenium cobalt and ruthenium cobalt vanadium and ruthenium and nickel vanadium and ruthenium.

The material can be added or charged to the reactor in a variety of forms. For example where the material is a metal it can be convenient to add the material as powder flakes pellets or ingots. The material can be charged all at once or in stages including continuously during the initial melt or energy addition step.

The backspace of the reactor can be advantageously purged by a gas such as a gas as described below or other gas. Nitrogen is a convenient gas for this purpose. In one example a nitrogen flow is maintained throughout an entire method such that a nitrogen pressure of about 0.4 0.6 psig or about 0.5 psig is maintained. Alternatively other gases such as argon may be used for such purposes.

Carbon sources of the present invention include materials that are partially primarily or totally comprised of carbon. Suitable carbon sources include graphite rods graphite powder graphite flakes fullerenes amorphous carbon diamonds natural gas methane ethane propane butane pentane and combinations thereof. A preferred carbon source has a high purity 

Carbon sources can be contacted with the material for variable periods of time. The period of time the carbon source is in contact with the material is the time between adding the carbon source and removing the undissolved carbon source. The period of time can be from about 0.5 hours to about 12 hours about 1 hour to about 10 hours about 2 hours to about 8 hours about 3 hours to about 6 hours about 3.5 hours to about 4.5 hours or about 3.9 hours to about 4.1 hours. Alternatively the period of time can be from about 5 minutes to about 300 minutes about 10 minutes to about 200 minutes about 20 minutes to about 120 minutes about 30 minutes to about 90 minutes about 40 minutes to about 80 minutes about 50 minutes to about 70 minutes or about 59 minutes to about 61 minutes. As can be seen above the process of the invention relies in part upon the cyclic iterative and or harmonic addition of energy to the material. In general the carbon contact period will coincide with a cycle series of cycles or iteration of steps.

A cycle of the present invention includes a period of time where the energy of a material is varied between a first and second selected energy endpoints with a return to the first energy endpoint. A half cycle is the completion of a single sweep or variant between a first and second energy endpoint. A full cycle is the completion of two sweeps between the first and second energy endpoints. A cyclic step refers to the repetition of two or more cycles without substantially changing the endpoints of each sweep. Iterations generally refer to the repeating of two or more steps such as a cyclic step in combination with a cooling step.

An energy level such as an endpoint can often be conveniently measured by the material s e.g. metal s temperature and or the degree to which a material e.g. metal is saturated with a second component e.g. carbon . Over a period of time varying the temperature involves a period of raising or increasing the temperature of a material e.g. metal or alloy and a period when the temperature of a material e.g. metal or alloy decreases either passively such as by convection or heat transfer to the surrounding environment or actively such as by a mechanical means or cooling e.g. quenching . The time period of each sweep can be selected to produce a harmonic energy pattern. The time period is also in part dictated by the rate of heating and cooling which is practical by the equipment e.g. induction furnace used the material selected and the mass of material being processed. In some experiments a cycle comprising a 7 minute period to increase the energy level sweep up and a 7 minute period to decrease the energy level sweep down was used. However other time periods e.g. 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 20 or more minutes can be used. Further combinations can be used 7 minutes up and 5 minutes down . Where energy is added to a material by other means e.g. ultraviolet or infrared radiation current or reactor power the time periods are not limited by the rate of heating or cooling the material.

Increasing the temperature of the metal or alloy increases the amount of carbon that can be dissolved into that metal or alloy which therefore decreases the degree to which the metal or alloy is saturated with carbon relative to the temperature and degree of carbon saturation when graphite saturation assemblies are removed the first time . Similarly decreasing the temperature of the metal or alloy increases the relative degree to which the metal or alloy is saturated with carbon. Thus carbon saturation levels of a material can also be used to measure or determine energy endpoints. Where the material to be modified is a non metal e.g. carbon gas the energy endpoints are better measured by temperature or associated emission spectra.

A cycle can also include or be interrupted or ended with a holding step. Thus the material can be held at an energy level as measured for example by the temperature or degree of carbon saturation for a selected period of time. The holding period can be several minutes to several hours or more. In one example the material was held for 60 minutes. In another example the material was held for 5 minutes. More than one hold step can be incorporated into the process and can be included in an iteration of steps.

The degree to which a metal is saturated with carbon varies over the course of the process as well as within a step. For example the degree of carbon saturation can vary between 70 and 95 in the first cycling step between 80 and 95 in the second cycling step between 101 and 103 in the third cycling step between 104 and 107 in the fourth cycling step between 108 and 118 in the fifth cycling step and between 114 and 118 in the sixth cycling step. It is preferred to conduct 4 or more supersaturation steps. Supersaturation is defined herein as follows 

Gas such as nitrogen hydrogen or a noble gas can be added during a cycle except where it is specified that gas addition is ceased prior to that cycle. The gas provides a third body effect for the reaction facilitating energy exchange. For example hydrogen helium nitrogen neon argon krypton xenon and carbon monoxide can be added. In a preferred embodiment the gas is added as a mixture. A preferred mixture comprises argon helium neon and or krypton. Preferably at least 50 more preferably at least 80 such as at least 90 by volume argon helium or hydrogen is present in the mixture. Particularly preferred mixtures by volume include 1 93 argon 5 helium and 2 neon 2 92 argon 5 helium and 3 neon 3 95 argon and 5 helium or neon 4 95 helium and 5 krypton 5 95 nitrogen and 5 helium 6 97 helium and 3 neon optionally trace amounts of krypton 7 97 argon and 3 neon 8 60 argon and 40 helium optionally trace amounts of neon hydrogen and or krypton 9 49.5 hydrogen 49.5 helium and 1 neon. In selecting the specific combination and concentrations of the gases the following factors should be considered emission profile Hodge spectral character and required momentum energy exchange.

In each embodiment the gas can be added at various rates. In general the gas is added in terms of the resulting agitation on the material and exchange with the material. As such the gas can be added at a low rate resulting in low agitation exchange at a modest moderate or high or vigorous rate. The gases can be mixed prior to adding or added individually. Using conventional fluid dynamic scaling models and assuming a crucible size of 3.75 inches I.D. with a 14.5 inch height holding 20 lbs of cobalt examples of low agitation can be achieved by adding about 0.25 SLPM modest agitation can be achieved by adding between about 1.25 SLPM moderate agitation can be achieved by adding between about 2.5 SLPM and high agitation can be achieved agitation by adding between about 5.0 SLPM. Selecting low agitation generally results in clearly defined bubbles in a quiescent bath. High agitation generally results in a turbulent well mixed bath. Modest and moderate agitation rates enables mixing and exchange to be adjusted between these extremes. In some instances the rate of addition can begin at one level and be changed during the step to a different level e.g. from a low rate to a vigorous rate . In general it is desirable to add the gas at a rate of excess to assist in controlling the reaction and ensuring that rate limiting steps are not associated with mass transfer diffusion. Flow rates for a crucible size of 8.875 inches with a 16.5 inch height holding 100 lbs of copper can be determined using standard scaling techniques based on bubble size and residence time distributions to achieve similar transport phenomena.

The gas can be added to the material either below or above including across the surface level of the material. When the gas is added below the surface level it can be added via injection ports from the bottom or sides of the reactor. However it is often preferred to add the gas via a lance. The lance can be positioned to provide gas entry below the surface level e.g. at the bottom of the reactor midpoint or near the surface of the material. When the lance is to be submerged it is often desirable to position the lance prior to or during the initial charging of the reactor with the material e.g. as the reactor is being packed with metal pellets . Where the lance is not submerged the lance can be placed to direct the gas across the surface of the material or toward at the surface. Where the gas is directed toward the material the gas can be directed at a force that creates an indentation in the surface. The lance can be placed along the centerline of the reactor. However it is often desirable to place the lance off center e.g. at about two thirds radius point as measured from the center. Lance placement involves consideration of mass energy transfer interaction of multiple lances and harmonic character of the reactants being added.

The material can be subjected or exposed to the gas either during the entire process or a cycle or series of cycles or alternating cycles during the cooling step or thereafter as a post treatment step.

Superior results in controlling the reaction have been achieved by exposing at least one gas to radiation. The exposure can be applied in a continuous or batch mode. For example the radiation source can be applied as the gas moves through a conduit for the gas source to the reactor. The conduit is preferably not opaque and is more preferably translucent or transparent. The radiation can be applied in an open or closed system. A closed system entails exposing the gas to the specified radiation in the substantial absence of other radiation sources e.g. visible light magnetic fields above background . This can be easily accomplished by building a black box surrounding a segment of the conduit and placing the radiation source s within the black box. An open system can also be employed where the radiation source s are not shielded from ambient light.

In yet other embodiments the material itself can be subjected to radiation either during or after the processes described herein. For example a tailored metal can be subjected to radiation to further modify the properties of the metal.

The radiation sources can be selected to provide a broad range of emitted wavelengths. For example the radiation can range from infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths. In one embodiment examples of preferred radiation sources emit into the range of 160 nm to 1000 nm in another embodiment examples of preferred radiation sources emit and into the range of 180 nm to 1100 nm and in a more preferred embodiment examples of preferred radiation sources emit into the range of 400 nm to 700 nm. The radiation can be conveniently supplied by short arc lamps high intensity discharge lamps pencil lamps lasers light emitting diodes incandescent fluorescent and or halogens for example. Examples of suitable high intensity discharge lamps include mercury vapor sodium vapor and or metal halide. Short arc lamps include mercury xenon or mercury xenon lamps. Pencil lamps include neon argon krypton xenon short wave ultraviolet long wave ultraviolet mercury mercury argon mercury neon and the like. The radiation can also include or exclude incandescent or fluorescent light and or natural sources of light such as electromagnetic radiation emitted by celestial bodies.

The radiation sources can optionally be used in combination with light shields or wavelength filters. Examples of suitable shields and filters can be obtained from UVP Inc. Upland Calif. . The filters and shields can direct or modify the emission output. Examples of UVP Pen Ray Filters include the G 275 filter which absorbs visible light while transmitting ultraviolet at 254 nm and the G 278 filter which converts shortwave radiation to longwave radiation at 365 nm. Pen Ray Shields include Shield A which has a 0.04 inch ID hole for point like source Shield B which has a 0.31 0.63 inch window and Shield C which has a 0.19 1.5 inch window. Filters and shields can also be obtained from Newport Corp. Irvine Calif. . The Newport 6041 Short Wave Filter absorbs visible lines the 6042 Long Wave Conversion Filter attenuates the 253.7 nm Hg line and fluoresces from 300 400 nm and the 6057 Glass Safety Filter absorbs the 253.7 nm Hg line and attenuates the 312.6 nm line. The Aperture Shields offered by Newport include the 6038 Pinhole Shield which has a 0.040 inch 1 mm diameter the 6039 Small Aperture Shield which has a 0.313 0.375 inch window and the 6040 Large Aperture Shield with a 0.188 1.50 inch window. Filters and shields can also be obtained from Edmund Industrial Optics Inc. Barrington N.J. . The Edmund UV Light Shield A has a 1 mm inner diameter drilled hole Shield B has a 7.9 mm 15.9 mm aperture and Shield C has a 4.8 mm 38.2 mm aperture.

The orientation of the lamp can also impact upon the result obtained. Thus in the embodiment where a gas is subjected to a radiation source the radiation source can be fixed to direct the radiation directly towards perpendicular away or parallel to the conduit directing the gas or its entry or exit point. The gases can be those discussed above or other gases such as air or oxygen. The radiation source can be positioned horizontally vertically and or at an angle above below across from the conduit. For example the base of a pencil lamp or other radiation source can be set at the same height of the conduit and the tip of the lamp directed or pointed toward the conduit. Alternatively the base of the pencil lamp or other radiation source can be set at the height of the conduit and the lamp directed at a 30 40 45 50 55 60 or 90 angle above below the conduit. Alternatively the base of the pencil lamp can be fixed above or below the level of the conduit. The tip of the pencil lamp can be pointed up or down in the direction of the gas flow or against the gas flow or at another angle with respect to any of the above. Further more than one of the same or different pencil lamps alone or in combination with other radiation sources can be used set at the same or different heights orientations and angles. The lamps can be presented in alternative orders first xenon then mercury or vice versa .

In an embodiment wherein the material to be treated is subjected to the radiation source similar positions can be achieved as above with respect to the gas conduit. The radiation source can be fixed to direct the radiation directly towards perpendicular away or parallel to the material. The radiation source can be positioned horizontally vertically and or at an angle above below across from the material. As above the base of a pencil lamp or other radiation source can be set at the same height of the material and the tip of the lamp directed or pointed toward the material. Alternatively the base of the pencil lamp or other radiation source can be set at the height of the material and the lamp directed at a 30 40 45 50 55 60 or 90 angle above below the material. Alternatively the base of the pencil lamp can be fixed above or below the level of the material. The tip of the pencil lamp can be pointed up or down in the direction of the gas flow or against the gas flow or at another angle with respect to any of the above. Further more than one of the same or different pencil lamps alone or in combination with other radiation sources can be used set at the same or different heights orientations and angles.

In a preferred embodiment the radiation source is a high intensity discharge lamp positioned to direct the radiation towards the material. The high intensity discharge lamp is combined with one or more pencil lamps positioned proximal to the high intensity discharge lamp. Often high intensity discharge lamps are equipped with a hood or reflector to direct the radiation. In some instances one or more pencil lamps can be placed inside and or behind the reflector.

Further the distance between the radiation source and the material and or gas conduit can impact the results achieved. For example the lamps can be placed between about 5 and 100 cm or more from the conduit and or material. In other embodiments the distance between the radiation source and the material and or gas conduit can be between about 100 cm and 5 meters or more.

In other instances the radiation can be filtered. Filters such as colored glass filters available from photography supply shops for example can be used. In yet other embodiments the filter can be other materials such as water gas air or other gas a manufactured or tailored material such as those materials described or made herein or a material of selected density chemical make up properties or structure. In one embodiment the filter can be placed between the radiation source s and the target metal or alloy or gas used in the method. Filters can also be called harmonic forcing functions . Forcing functions can be used in conjunction with electromagnetic radiation sources to affect a change in a material. In addition gases may be injected into apparatus containing a forcing function to modify the performance of the assembly.

In one embodiment the radiation source has an environment which is different from that of the material. This can be accomplished by directing a gas flow into the lamp environment. Where the radiation source is a pencil lamp within a box to radiate a gas this can be accomplished by direct gas flow into the box. In other embodiments the radiation source can be a short arc lamp or a short arc lamp assembly. In such embodiments the gas can be introduced into the reflector proximate to the lamp. The gas includes those gases discussed above.

The radiation can be applied continuously or discontinuously e.g. pulsed or toggled and its intensity can be modulated. Where the radiation is applied continuously the radiation can begin prior to introduction of the gas into the conduit or after. It can be applied for the duration of a cycle or series of cycles. Where the radiation is pulsed the length of each pulse can be the same or different. Generally the radiation is applied to induce harmonic change altering the gas or target materials prior to their introduction into the reactor. This is conveniently accomplished by controlling the lamps with a computer. The factors to be considered in radiation source placement exposure and sequence include the desired wavelength intensity and energy characteristics the angle of incidence and the harmonic profile to be injected into the targeted material e.g. gas metal tailored metal radiated gas and the like .

In some instances the radiation source and or pencil lamp s and or filters and or target material or gas are advantageously cooled. For example where a high intensity discharge lamp is used in combination with a pencil lamp s it may be advantageous to cool the pencil lamp to prevent damage. Alternatively where a short arc lamp is used in combination with pencil lamps and or glass filters it may be advantageous to cool the pencil lamps to prevent damage as well as the glass filter to prevent breakage.

Other sources of energy can be used to further tailor the materials of the invention. For example DC current can be applied continuously or the amperage varied for example between 0 300 amps such as 0 150 amps. AC current can be applied continuously or varied e.g. in a wave pattern such as a sinusoidal wave square wave or triangle wave pattern of a selected frequency and amplitude. Typically 10 volts peak to peak is used at 0 3.5 MHz 0 28 MHz or 0 50 MHz. In other embodiments the peak to peak voltage was less that about 15 vdc 10 vdc 8 vdc 7.2 vdc 5 vdc 1.7 vdc and 1 vdc. In one embodiment electrodes can be placed in the reactor such as below the surface of the material and current applied. As with the radiation discussed above the current can be applied to coincide with a cycle or series of cycles or during all or a part of a single step of the process. Often the power supply is turned on prior to attachment to the electrodes to avoid any power surge impacts.

Further the cooling step can alter the results of the process. Such cooling can include gradual and or rapid cooling steps. Gradual cooling typically includes cooling due to heat exchange with air or other gas over 1 to 72 hours 2 to 50 hours 3 to 30 hours or 8 to 72 hours. Rapid cooling also known as quenching typically includes an initial cooling with air or other gas to below the solidus temperature thereby forming a solid mass and placing the solid mass into a bath comprising a suitable fluid such as tap water distilled water deionized water other forms of water gases as defined above liquid nitrogen or other suitable liquified gases a thermally stable oil e.g. silicone oil or organic coolant and combinations thereof. The bath should contain a suitable quantity of liquid at a suitable temperature such that the desired amount of cooling occurs. The ingot can be removed from the crucible before or after completing the cooling. While the material is cooling the environment can be stirred mixed or agitated. This can be accomplished by maintaining a flow of coolant over the material or agitating the cooling bath or environment. Alternatively the coolant is not disturbed or agitated and circulation of the coolant is minimized.

In one embodiment the material is cooled in a different vessel cooling or quench chamber . The cooling chamber can be for example a polyethylene or other plastic container. The ingot can be placed directly or indirectly into the cooling vessel e.g. in a vertical or horizontal orientation . Generally the ingot can be placed at least about 6 inches from the inside wall of the container. The height of the coolant can be at least about 12 inches above and below the surface of the ingot. A refractory material e.g. a ceramic block rinsed with coolant e.g. DI water and optionally dried or allowed to dry may be used to support the ingot in the quench chamber.

Where the material is cooled in a different vessel from the reactor or induction furnace the material can be removed manually or robotically to a clean protected surface. This removal may be accomplished manually using a pair of tongs e.g. cast iron steel stainless steel nickel titanium tungsten or other high temperature melting transition metal . Manual removal can also be accomplished by donning heavy insulated heat resistant gloves.

Where the crucible is removed from the reactor with the material the crucible should be removed before or after cooling. The crucible can be removed by gently peeling it away from the material. A hammer ram or wedge can be used to perform this function. However care should be used to avoid striking the material hard with the hammer or otherwise causing a substantial impact upon or metal contact with the material. In one embodiment the crucible removal can be performed in the presence of air at about 350 75 F. 750 250 F. 1100 250 F. or at T 75 F. T 5 F.

One example of the base method can be described in terms of carbon saturation values. After a metal or alloy is added to a suitable reactor establish the dissolved carbon level at 70 to 95 of the equilibrium saturation of carbon for the thermodynamic state specified e.g. T P composition when the composition is in its natural state hereinafter the equilibrium saturation of carbon is referred to as C . Identify temperature set points for 80 and 95 C . Vary the temperature between the predetermined set points such that the temperature is decreased for 7 minutes and increased over 7 minutes per cycle for 15 cycles. Next establish a flow of argon. Vary the temperature between the predetermined set points such that the temperature is decreased for 7 minutes and increased over 7 minutes per cycle for 5 cycles the temperature should be maintained above 70 C at all times and maintained below 95 C at all times. The carbon level is raised to saturation i.e. C with continued argon addition. Hold for 60 minutes at saturation i.e. C with continued argon addition. Raise the carbon level to 1 i.e. 1 represents 1 above the saturation value as defined in its natural equilibrium state C of C with continued argon addition and hold for 5 minutes. Vary the temperature for 20 cycles between 1 and 3 of C such that the temperature is decreased over 9 minutes and increased over 9 minutes per cycle. Cease argon addition. Cool the metal to 4 of C . Vary the temperature for 4.5 cycles between 4 and 7 of C such that the temperature is decreased over 3 minutes and increased over 5 minutes. Argon is added as the carbon saturation increases and nitrogen is added as carbon saturation decreases. Cool the metal to obtain 8 with continued argon addition. Vary the temperature over 15.5 cycles between 8 and 18 of C such that the temperature is decreased over 15 minutes and increased over 15 minutes. Argon is added as the carbon saturation increases and nitrogen is added as carbon saturation decreases. After the 15.5 cycles are complete gas addition is halted. Perform one complete cycle by varying the temperature between 18 to 14 of C ending at 18 such that the temperature is increased over 15 minutes and decreased over 15 minutes. Proceed immediately to a cool down that leads to solidification. The present process also includes one or more of the further improvements described above.

Cycles of the present invention can vary in duration. The duration of a cycle can vary among cycles in a step. A cycle duration is for example about 2 minutes to about 90 minutes about 3 minutes to about 67 minutes about 5 minutes to about 45 minutes about 8 minutes to about 30 minutes about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes about 14 minutes to about 18 minutes about 7 minutes to about 9 minutes about 13 minutes to about 15 minutes about 17 minutes to about 19 minutes about 28 minutes to about 32 minutes or about 29 minutes to about 31 minutes.

A cycle can be symmetric or asymmetric. In a symmetric cycle the period of increasing the metal or alloy temperature is equal to the period of decreasing the metal or alloy temperature. In an asymmetric cycle the period of increasing the metal or alloy temperature is different than the period of decreasing the metal or alloy temperature. For an asymmetric cycle the period of increasing the metal or alloy temperature can be longer than or shorter than the period of decreasing the metal or alloy temperature.

For example in a cycle lasting about 7 minutes to about 9 minutes the temperature can be increased for about 3 minutes and the temperature can be decreased for about 5 minutes. If the cycle lasts about 13 minutes to about 15 minutes the temperature can be increased for about 7 minutes and the temperature can be decreased for about 7 minutes. If the cycle lasts about 17 minutes to about 19 minutes the temperature can be increased for about 9 minutes and the temperature can be decreased for about 9 minutes. If the cycle lasts about 29 minutes to about 31 minutes the temperature can be increased for about 15 minutes and the temperature can decreased for about 15 minutes.

The number of cycles in a step is generally an integer or half integer value. For example the number of cycles in a step can be one or more one to forty or one to twenty. The number of cycles can be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 or 40 or more. Alternatively the number of cycles in a step can be 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 9.5 10.5 11.5 12.5 13.5 14.5 15.5 16.5 17.5 18.5 19.5 20.5 21.5 22.5 23.5 24.5 25.5 26.5 27.5 28.5 29.5 or 30.5 or more. In a step comprising a half integer or a non integer quantity of cycles either heating or cooling can occur first.

After the initial heating step the temperature of a metal or an alloy is sufficiently high such that the temperature is equal to or greater than the solidus temperature. The solidus temperature varies depending on the metal or the alloy and the amount of carbon dissolved therein. The temperature at the end of Step F. of the third paragraph of the summary is typically about 900 F. to about 3000 F. but varies from metal to metal.

Suitable reactors are selected depending on the amount of metal or alloy to be processed mode of heating extent of heating temperature required and the like. A preferred reactor in the present method is an induction furnace reactor which is capable of operating in a frequency range of 0 Hz to about 10 000 Hz 0 Hz to about 3 000 Hz or 0 Hz to about 1 000 Hz. Reactors operating at lower frequencies are desirable for larger metal charges such that a reactor operating at 0 3 000 Hz is generally suitable for 20 pound metal charges and a reactor operating at 0 1 000 Hz is generally suitable for 5000 pound metal charges.

Typically reactors of the present method are lined with a suitable crucible and appropriately sealed from the external environment enabling very tight control of the internal chemical environment e.g. part per thousand part per million or the like . Crucibles are selected in part based on the amount of metal or alloy to be heated and the temperature of the method. Crucibles selected for the present method typically have a capacity from about five pounds to about five tons.

A preferred analytical method is x ray fluorescence spectrometry. X ray fluorescence spectrometry is described in X Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry by George J. Havrilla in Handbook of Instrumental Techniques for Analytical Chemistry Frank A. Settle Ed. Prentice Hall Inc 1997 which is incorporated herein by reference. XRF spectrometry is a well known and long practiced method which has been used to detect and quantify or semi quantify the elemental composition for elements with Z 11 of solid and liquid samples. This technique benefits from minimal sample preparation wide dynamic range and being nondestructive. Typically XRF data are not dependent on which dimension e.g. axial or radial of a sample was analyzed. Accuracy of less than 1 error can generally be achieved with XRF spectrometry and the technique can have detection limits of parts per million.

XRF spectrometry first involves exciting an atom such that an inner shell electron is ejected. Upon ejection of an electron an outer shell electron will drop down into the lower energy position of the ejected inner shell electron. When the outer shell electron drops into the lower energy inner shell x ray energy is released. Typically an electron is ejected from the K L or M shell and is replaced by an electron from the L M or N shell. Because there are numerous combinations of ejections and replacements possible for any given element x rays of several energies are emitted during a typical XRF experiment. Therefore each element in the Periodic Table has a standard pattern of x ray emissions after being excited by a sufficiently energetic source since each such element has its own characteristic electronic state. By matching a pattern of emitted x ray energies to values found in tables such as those on pages 10 233 to 10 271 of Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 73Edition edited by D. R. Lide CRC Press 1992 which is incorporated herein by reference one can identify which elements are present in a sample. In addition the intensity of the emitted x rays allows one to quantify the amount of an element in a sample.

There are two standard variations of the XRF technique. First as an energy dispersive method EDXRF the XRF technique uses a detector such as a Si Li detector capable of simultaneously measuring the energy and intensity of x ray photons from an array of elements. EDXRF is well suited for rapid acquisition of data to determine gross elemental composition. Typically the detection limits for EDXRF are in the range of tens to hundreds of parts per million. A wavelength dispersive technique WDXRF is generally better suited for analyses requiring high accuracy and precision. WDXRF uses a crystal to disperse emitted x rays based on Bragg s Law. Natural crystals such as lithium fluoride and germanium are commonly used for high energy short wavelength x rays while synthetic crystals are commonly used for low energy longer wavelength x rays. Crystals are chosen in part to achieve desired resolution so that x rays of different energies are dispersed to distinguishable 2 angles. WDXRF can either measure x rays sequentially such that a WDXRF instrument will step through a range of 2 angles in recording a spectrum or there will be detectors positioned at multiple 2 angles allowing for more rapid analysis of a sample. Detectors for WDXRF commonly include gas ionization and scintillation detectors. A further description of the use of WDXRF technique in the present invention can be found in Example 1. Results from EDXRF and results from WDXRF can be compared by determining the relationship between a 2 angle and the wavelength of the corresponding x ray e.g. using Bragg s Law and converting the wavelength into energy e.g. energy equals the reciprocal of the wavelength multiplied by Planck s constant and the velocity of light .

Analysis of emitted x rays can be carried out automatically or semi automatically such as by using a software package e.g. UniQuant which is sold by Omega Data Systems BV Veldhoven The Netherlands for either EDXRF or WDXRF. UniQuant is used for standard less semi quantitative to quantitative XRF analysis using the intensities measured by a sequential x ray spectrometer. The software package unifies all types of samples into one analytical program. The UniQuant software program is highly effective for analyzing samples for which no standards are available. Sample preparation is usually minimal or not required at all. Samples can be of very different natures sizes and shapes. Elements from fluorine or sodium up to uranium or their oxide compounds can be analyzed in samples such as a piece of glass a screw metal drillings lubricating oil loose fly ash powder polymers phosphoric acid thin layers on a substrate soil paint the year rings of trees and in general those samples for which no standards are available. The reporting is in weight along with an estimated error for each element.

In software packages such as UniQuant an XRF spectrum is composed of data channels. Each data channel corresponds to an energy range and contains information about the number of x rays emitted at that energy. The data channels can be combined into one coherent plot to show the number or intensity of emitted x rays versus energy or 2 angle the 2 angle is related to the wavelength of an x ray such that the plot will show a series of peaks. An analysis of the peaks by one skilled in the art or the software package can identify the correspondence between the experimentally determined peaks and the previously determined peaks of individual elements. For an element peak location i.e. the centroid of the peak with respect to energy or 2 angle peak profile shape peak creation and peak fluidity would be expected to be essentially the same within experimental error for any sample containing the element. If the same quantity of an element is present in two samples intensity will also be essentially the same excepting experimental error and matrix effects.

A typical software package is programmed to correlate certain data channels with the emitted x rays of elements. Quantification of the intensity of emitted x rays is accomplished by integrating the XRF spectrum over a number of data channels. Based on the measured intensities and the previously compiled data on elements the software package will integrate over all data channels correlate the emitted x ray intensities and will then calculate the relative abundance or quantity of elements which appear to be present in a sample based upon comparison to the standards. Composition of matter changes produced by the present invention will generally be characterized by an XRF spectrum that reports 1 the presence of an element which was not present in the starting material and was not added during the process 2 an increased amount of an element that was not added to the process in the amount measured or 3 a decreased amount of an element that was not removed during the process in the amount indicated. Examples of 3 include a reduction in identifiable spectra referencing the sum before normalization and or reappearance of an element upon combustion. Products of the present invention can also be characterized by the difference between XRF Uniquant analysis such as by burning the sample e.g. LECO analysis described in more detail below.

A LECO analysis is meant to include an analysis conducted by the CS 300 Carbon Sulfur determinator supplied by a LECO computer. The CS 300 Carbon Sulfur determinator is a microprocessor based software driven instrument for measurement of carbon and sulfur content in metals ores ceramics and other inorganic materials.

Analysis begins by weighing out a sample 1 g nominal into a ceramic crucible on a balance. Accelerator material is added the crucible is placed on the loading pedestal and the ANALYZE key is pressed. Furnace closure is performed automatically then the combustion chamber is purged with oxygen to drive off residual atmospheric gases. After purging oxygen flow through the system is restored and the induction furnace is turned on. The inductive elements of the sample and accelerator couple with the high frequency field of the furnace. The pure oxygen environment and the heat generated by this coupling cause the sample to combust. During combustion all elements of the sample oxidize. Carbon bearing elements are reduced releasing the carbon which immediately binds with the oxygen to form CO and CO2 the majority being CO2. Also sulfur bearing elements are reduced releasing sulfur which binds with oxygen to form SO.

Sample gases are swept in the carrier stream. Sulfur is measured as sulfur dioxide in the first IR cell. A small amount of carbon monoxide is converted to carbon dioxide in the catalytic heater assembly while sulfur trioxide is removed from the system in a cellulose filter. Carbon is measured as carbon dioxide in the IR cells as gases flow trough the IR cells.

Ideally the relative abundances will total 100 prior to normalization. However for a variety of reasons such as improper or insufficient calibration and or non planar sample surface the relative abundances will not total 100 prior to normalization. Another reason that the relative abundances of elements do not total 100 prior to normalization is that a portion of the XRF spectrum falls outside of the data channels that the software package correlates with an element i.e. a portion of the XRF spectrum is not recognized as belonging to an element and is not included in the relative abundance calculation . In this case the relative abundances will likely total less than 100 prior to normalization. Further the samples will often have anisotropic characteristics whereby an axial scan is distinct from a radial scan. Thus products of the invention may be characterized by an XRF spectrum that is not recognized by the Uniquant software e.g. sum of known concentrations before normalization is less than 100 described herein in an amount for example of less than 98 such as less than 90 such as less than 80 . In additional embodiments the software package reports or detects one or more elements not detected by other methods or are detected in different quantities.

X ray emission spectrometry XES a technique analogous to XRF also provides electronic information about elements. In XES a lower energy source is used to eject electrons from a sample such that only the surface to several micrometers of the sample is analyzed. Similar to XRF a series of peaks is generated which corresponds to outer shell electrons replacing ejected inner shell electrons. The peak shape peak fluidity peak creation peak intensity peak centroid and peak profile are expected to be essentially the same within experimental error and matrix effects for two samples having the same composition.

Thus XES analysis of the control standard compared to the atomically altered i.e. manufactured or tailored state can also be analyzed. Manufactured copper in the axial direction exhibits similar composition to natural copper i.e. 99.98 but radial scans exhibit new peaks in the region close to naturally occurring S Cl and K. The shifting centroid of the observed peaks from the natural species i.e. S Cl and K confirms electronic change in the atomic state of the base element. Conventional chemical analysis performed using a LECO IR analyzer to detect SOin the vapor phase post sample combustion confirmed the absence of sulfur at XES lower detection limits.

Non contact magnetic force microscopy image or scanning tunneling microscopy STM scan can also confirm the production of a new composition of matter or manufactured or tailored material identified by an altered and aligned electromagnetic network. Individually and from differing vantage points these scans show the outline of the changed electromagnetic energy network.

New compositions of matter can be electronically modified to induce long range ordering alignment. Optical microscopy and SEM imaging of the material verifies the degree and extent of long range ordering achieved.

Non contact magnetic force microscopy image or scanning tunneling microscopy STM scans can also confirm the production of a new composition of matter or manufactured or tailored material identified by an altered and aligned electromagnetic network. Individually and from differing vantage points these scans can show the outline of the changed electromagnetic energy network. Non contact MFM imaging can show that products of the invention often possess clear pattern repetition and intensity of the manufactured material when compared to the natural material or starting material. Products of the invention can be characterized by the presence of magnetic properties in high purity non magnetic metals such as elemental copper e.g. 99.98 .

Products can also be characterized by color changes. The variation in color of copper products ranged from black copper gold silver and red. Other visual variations included translucency and near transparency at regions. While not being bound by theory the alteration of copper s electronic state along the continuum enables the new composition of matter s color to be adjusted along the continuum.

In several examples of the present invention the ingots obtained by the process possess a substantial internal void and absence of a crown of material on the top surface. In other examples of the invention the ingot is characterized by essentially no void with a crown of material on the top.

Other products of the processes are characterized by changes in hardness. The variation in diamond pyramid hardness between different manufactured copper samples ranged from about 25 to 90 or 3 to 9 times higher than natural copper . Hardness change can be anisotropic.

The operations described in the embodiments presented herein did not result merely from empirical explorations. Rather guidance was obtained from theoretical considerations regarding the topological aspects of electrodynamics. These enabled specification of the range and duration of temperature cycles the selection of specific combinations and concentrations of gases to be used geometric factors affecting the lance placement and all other chief features of the experimental protocols. While not being bound by theory the Applicant believes the application of topological principleswhen applied to electrodynamics provides a powerful means for altering the properties of materials.

As noted in U.S. Ser. No. 09 416 720 the theoretical analysis can be formulated in terms of an allowed set of mathematical poles defined as the zurn operator and further characterized by the set of mathematical poles coalesced defined as the isozurn value. Adjusting or manipulating the zurn causes the isozurn value to differ from its starting or naturally occurring value thereby modifying the electronic structure from that of the natural state.

The products produced by the process have utilities readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Indeed materials which comprise metals can be used to manufacture products having adjustable chemical properties e.g. regioselectivity regiospecificity or reaction rate electronic properties e.g. band gap susceptibility resistivity or magnetism mechanical properties e.g. ductility or hardness and or optical properties e.g. color .

In addition while raising the temperature a 0.15 L min flow of 40 helium 60 argon and trace neon was added and while lowering the temperature a 0.3 L min flow of 40 argon 60 helium trace neon trace hydrogen and trace krypton was added. After the 4.5 cycles the short wave radiation source within the sealed enclosure was terminated. The reactor temperature was then lowered to 2438 F. over 1 minute. The temperature was varied between 2406 F. and 2438 F. for 15.5 cycles. Each cycle consisted of lowering the temperature continuously over 15 minutes and raising the temperature continuously over 15 minutes. In addition while raising the temperature a 0.15 L min flow of 40 helium 60 argon and trace neon was added and while lowering the temperature a 0.3 L min flow of 40 argon 60 helium trace neon trace hydrogen and trace krypton was added.

The temperature was then varied between 2419 F. and 2406 F. for one cycle. The cycle consisted of raising the temperature continuously over 15 minutes and lowering the temperature continuously over 15 minutes. At the completion of this temperature sweep the reactor temperature was lowered to Tplus 11 F. over 45 minutes.

Upon reaching Tplus 11 F. gas addition was changed to 0.3 L min of 100 hydrogen and trace neon and held for five minutes. The reactor was then cooled to Tplus 10 F. over five minutes. Upon reaching Tplus 10 F. the gas addition lance was relocated into the headspace of the reactor such that a quarter inch inches dimple could be observed on the bath surface. The bath was held at Tplus 10 F. for an additional 5 minutes for conditioning and equilibrization. The reactor was then cooled to Tplus 8 F. while maintaining a temperature lowering rate of no more than 3 F. hr. Upon reaching Tplus 8 F. a manual power pulse of 2 kW was introduced with a single continuous up down sweep from normal holding power. The reactor was then cooled to Tplus 2 F. while maintaining a temperature lowering rate of no more than 3 F. hr. Upon reaching Tplus 2 F. a manual power pulse of 1.5 kW was introduced with a single continuous up down sweep from normal holding power. Furthermore immediately following the manual power pulse the gas flow rate was changed to 0.15 L min of 49.5 hydrogen 49.5 helium and 1 neon. The reactor was then cooled to Tagain maintaining a temperature lowering rate of no more than 3 F. hr. Upon reaching T the reactor temperature was lowered to Tminus 75 F. over five hours. Upon reaching Tminus 75 F. the flow rate was changed to 30 ml min of 60 helium 40 hydrogen and trace neon.

Immediately following removal the ingot was transferred into a quench chamber containing water ensuring that the top of the ingot surface was covered by at least 6 inches of water. The ingot was allowed to stay in the quench vessel for 6 hours prior to its removal from the quench vessel.

Note An identical experimental program except for the use of pencil lamps which provided a source of electromagnetic radiation to the third body gases was also performed verifying the efficacy of the improved process See 14 03 03 in Table 1 and attending discussions .

An ARL 8410 XRF was used to analyze each of the sample ingots. An ARL 8410 is a sequential wavelength dispersive spectrometer WDS . Specific emission lines are used to determine the presence or absence and the concentrations of various elements. Each characteristic x ray line is measured in sequence by the instrument by controlling the instrument geometry.

The ARL 8410 WDS spectrometer relies on the fundamentals of x ray diffraction. X ray fluorescence occurs when matter is bombarded by a stream of high energy incident x ray photons. When the incident X radiation strikes the sample the incident x rays may be absorbed scattered or transmitted for the measurement of the fluorescent yield.

The ARL 8410 utilizes an end window rhodium Rh x ray tube. The end window is composed of beryllium and holds the tube at high vacuum. The filaments are heated giving off electrons by thermoionic emission. This beam of electrons then bombards the target Rh anode across a 10 70 keV voltage potential. Thus primary x rays are produced during the collision. The emitted x ray spectrum consists of 1 Continuum or Bremstrahlung radiation 2 Characteristic x ray lines of the target material e.g. K and L series and 3 Characteristic lines from any contaminants. Thus the primary spectrum appears as a series of sharp intense peaks arrayed over a broad hump of continuum radiation. The ARL is equipped with and uses two types of photon detectors the Flow Proportional Counter FPC and the Scintillation Counter SC .

The manufactured metal samples unless otherwise specified are prepared by cutting a sample with an approximate cross section of 1.1875 from the cooled ingot. The axial edge and radial edge are then denoted. For non brittle samples a cube shaped sample is used. When possible a smooth surface is prepared for analysis the axial and radial faces are sequentially polished. The sample faces are sanded to 400 grit and then a polishing wheel is employed with 600 grit paper. Finally a 1 m polishing compound completes the smoothing process.

Prior to analysis the sample is cleaned with isopropyl alcohol IPA and placed in a sample cassette holder. The sample holder is then loaded into the XRF.

The orientation of the detector crystal with respect to the sample and the photon detector is controlled synchronously such that characteristic x ray lines can be accurately measured. A sequential measurement consists of positioning the diffraction crystal at a given theta diffraction angle and the detector at two theta and counting for a given period of time. The crystal and detector are then rotated to a different angle for the next characteristic x ray line.

XRF 386 Software by Fisons Instruments is used to control the crystal and detector placement. Uniquant Version 2 software developed by Omega Data Systems provides the data reduction algorithms for each analytical protocol. The sample results include an elemental composition list along with the associated concentrations for each sample.

The magnetic and material attraction properties of the manufactured ingots were tested via four methods 

Hardness testing was performed via multiple techniques including Moh s hardness testing and Rockwell hardness testing both standard techniques . In Moh s hardness testing the test angle approaches 0 while in Rockwell testing the test angle approaches 90 . By testing at multiple angles changes to different contributing aspects of changing the composition of matter could be tested.

The Rockwell method ASTM 18 84 Standard Test Methods for Rockwell Hardness and Rockwell Superficial Hardness of Metallic Materials employs either a ball or a diamond cone in a precision testing instrument that is designed to measure depth of penetration accurately. Two superimposed impressions are made one with a load of 10 kg and the second with a load of 100 kg. The depth to which the major load drives the ball or cone below that depth to which the minor load has previously driven it is taken as a measure of the hardness. For hardened steels greater accuracy is obtained by using a diamond cone 120 with slightly rounded tip applied under a major load of 150 kg. The Rockwell hardness test B uses the 1 16 diameter steel ball with a 100 kg load. Scale B is appropriate for copper alloys soft steels aluminum alloys malleable iron etc. Scale C is appropriate for steel hard cast irons pearlitic malleable iron titanium deep case hardened steel and other materials harder than B 100. The method using the cone is designated Rockwell C test. Based on the depth of the indentation the hardness scale can be read directly from the scale the higher the number the harder the material. The dial like scale is really a depth gauge graduated in special units specific to the test being performed e.g. Rockwell Hardness C.

The Rockwell results are a useful measure of relative resistance to indentation however the Rockwell test does not serve well as a predictor of other properties such as strength or resistance to scratches abrasion or wear. Hence the Rockwell hardness test cannot be used alone for product specifications.

The Moh s Scales in use since 1822 is used to rank the relative hardness of minerals via the ability of materials to resist scratching by another material. Moh s scale consists of 10 minerals arranged in order from 1 to 10. Diamond is rated as the hardest and is indexed as 10. Talc is indexed as 1 and is the softest. Each mineral in the scale will scratch those below it 

The color of each sample is noted via visual evaluation. In addition unique surface configurations are documented for example the expulsion of material from the bath upon cooling . Digital photography is used to document the physical appearance.

The following is a list of manufactured materials prepared by the techniques described herein and the ingot compositions.

Appendix 2 shows tables of XRF data results for the manufactured materials. Note in each table the apparent detection of materials not present in the initial starting materials. Such detections are indicative of a shift in the energy of the manufactured materials manifesting itself in false positives for the detection of elements not present.

In addition despite the fact that the manufactured ingots were prepared in a very well mixed reactor where composition should be homogeneous significant apparent compositional differences exist in the axial and radial directions. Note XRF data for each ingot is presented in back to back tables in Appendix 2. This anisotropic behavior is again indicative of changes in the energy patterning of the manufactured materials.

Such shifts in energy are demonstrated best in identical experiments that were performed manufacturing copper Runs 14 03 02 and 14 03 03 . The primary difference in these two experimental runs was to perform electromagnetic EM energy addition to the third body gases prior to injection into the reactor. The XRF results for these experiments are summarized below in Table 2 

Visual inspection of the manufactured materials indicates that the physical characteristics of the material have been dramatically altered. Major physical changes can include color texture the appearance of void spaces in the ingot internals the expulsion of metal during the cooling process and apparent volumetric changes.

Comparison of ingots of similar composition but manufactured via alternate techniques can exemplify the physical manifestations of changes to the composition of matter. The exterior volume of ingot 14 04 01 Example 1 of U.S. Ser. No. 10 123 028 substituting Al for Cu is significantly greater 30 than 14 04 02 with an internal void in the ingot that runs approximately 80 down the length of the ingot. Interestingly the ingot 14 04 01 was subjected to lower volumetric gas flow rates than ingot 14 04 02 hence gas expansion is not a plausible explanation for the physical differences. Additionally the ingot prepared via the subject method exhibits a definite charcoal appearance as opposed to the silvery appearance of 14 04 01. The exteriors are also different smooth versus foil like. Note that the magnetic behavior of ingot 14 04 01 was stronger than that of 14 04 02 yet both exhibited magnetic behavior not seen in natural aluminum. See magnetic attraction section for a discussion of magnetic attraction in tailored materials.

Similar differences in physical appearance were observed in manufactured copper ingots as well. The observed physical differences between the two ingots were 

Interesting physical characteristics were also observable in copper ingots prepared by one of the alternate techniques described herein. Based on alterations to the experimental plan for example changes to the third body addition and or electromagnetic radiation sources the material outcome were significantly different.

Two copper ingots developed via an identical experimental plan except for the addition of electromagnetic radiation through third body addition. The surface of ingot 14 03 02 was smooth and exhibits what could be described as a wood grain finish. Ingot 14 03 03 exhibited a dimpled rough finish with what appeared to be mosaic patterning.

Material expulsion to form a crown was also more significant in run 14 03 03. The color in ingot 14 03 02 followed the traditional copper coloring more closely than 14 03 03 that exhibited a broader spectrum of colors including red and brown tones. As Table 2 shows the induced elements were different for the two runs despite being prepared in the same containment system with identical operating conditions except for the addition of EM radiation to third body gases. Hence the composition of matter has clearly been altered in both of these manufactured ingots.

Hardness testing was performed on material standards natural copper manufactured copper prepared via the technique outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 6 572 792 B1 and manufactured copper prepared by the technique delineated herein. Two primary hardness techniques were used Rockwell Hardness and Moh s Hardness.

The Metals Handbook defines hardness as Resistance of metal to plastic deformation usually by indentation . However the term may also refer to stiffness or temper to resistance to scratching abrasion or cutting. Hardness testing does not give a direct measurement of an engineering performance property it correlates well with strength wear resistance and other properties.

Rockwell Hardness testing is an indentation testing method in which an indenter is impressed into the test sample at a prescribed load to measure the material s resistance to deformation. A Rockwell hardness number is then calculated from the depth of permanent deformation of the sample after application and removal of the test load. Various indenter shapes and sizes combined with a range of test loads form a matrix of Rockwell hardness scales.

Moh s Hardness testing is a scratch test in which known standards are used to scratch materials to specify surface hardness through resistance to scratching. Interesting test results were obtained in the testing of many of the manufactured ingots. For example a sample could exhibit an exceptionally high Moh s hardness i.e. resistance to scratching indicative of strong interfacial energy enhancement yet shatter under the Rockwell Hardness Test i.e. highly brittle material .

A Moh s scratch test was performed on a manufactured Fe V Cr Mn ingot. The surface was impervious to scratching by the Moh s Standard for a hardness of 10 diamond. In fact the diamond tip was actually damaged by the manufactured alloy indicating that the tailored material had an apparent Moh s Hardness 10. Tool steel a man made material of natural elements with a similar composition to this tailored ingot typically has a Moh s hardness between 6 and 7. This tailored material exhibited a hardness far exceeding that which would be expected from natural materials and greater than that which had been seen in any previous manufactured material i.e. materials prepared via the method presented in U.S. Pat. No. 6 572 792 . Quite clearly this process for tailoring material can significantly raise the hardness with an abundance of beneficial commercially relevant implications e.g. drilling mining etc. .

Similar results on another tailored copper ingot compared with some standards provided by the testing manufacturer. Note that the tailored material exhibited a very high Moh s hardness factor and exhibited greater hardness in the radial direction than in the axial direction. This anisotropic hardness behavior is generated through material tailoring. Despite this Moh s hardness factor the same tailored ingot exhibited brittle failure during the Rockwell testing.

Three different copper ingots were tailored via the techniques described herein. Each of these ingots was subjected to a slightly different experimental protocol. For example the experimental program may have varied by the time type or method of EM radiation addition. The resultant magnetic and physical attraction properties of each ingot are significantly different from natural copper and significantly different from each other. The attraction behavior of these three ingots is summarized in below 

Each ingot exemplified magnetic attraction induced by the tailoring process behavior not present in natural copper. In addition to magnetic attraction these ingots exhibited attraction to other non magnetic materials such as sulfur. In each case the testing for the attraction behavior of the sulfur powder was performed on a clean polished dry surface of the ingot to prohibit any effects of surface tension or adhesion. Additionally the areas of magnetic attraction and sulfur attraction were at significantly different locations on the ingot removing the possibility of induced attraction or other extraneous surface effects.

Each of these points supports the supposition of a change in the composition of matter affecting the electromagnetic behavior of the tailored material. Natural copper exhibits no attraction to either magnets or sulfur. Yet the manufactured copper tailored via three different protocols all exhibited unique attraction behavior.

In addition to pure copper various alloys were subjected to the experimental protocol outlined herein and similar results were obtained non ferromagnetic material attraction ferromagnetic material attraction and magnetic attraction.

The first example of such behavior is a Nickel Rhenium ingot Ingot 14 01 21. This ingot composed predominantly of Ni will attract a magnet in its natural state. Hence no magnetic testing was performed. However the attraction of sulfur powder and various ferromagnetic materials Fe chips 99 purity 10 25 mesh spherical sponge Fe ranging from 50 to 100 mesh 99.8 pure and Fe powder 94 Fe 3 S and 3 C none of which are attracted to natural nickel or rhenium in the absence of an induced magnetic field caused by the presence of a magnet were tested.

The Nickel Rhenium tailored ingot exhibited unique material attraction throughout the entire ingot i.e. a volumetric property vs. a surface property as exemplified on multiple faces of the cut ingot. To further demonstrate that surface irregularities are not the source of the unique attraction an ingot was cut and the surface polished. The clean dry polished surface was then used for evaluating the attraction behavior of tailored materials.

In a similar emulation of the behavior observed in the tailored copper ingots the tailored Nickel Rhenium ingot also exhibited significant attraction to sulfur powder.

To further demonstrate that the attraction behavior is caused by a change in the composition of matter that in turn alters the electromagnetic behavior of the tailored material a polished surface of the Ni Re tailored ingot was tested for sulfur attraction i.e. eliminate the effects of surface irregularities . Additionally the ingot was rotated 180 . The same attraction patterning was observed independent of vertical orientation eliminating a surface lip or defect as a possible explanation for the attraction.

To demonstrate that the attraction behavior observed was not unique to nickel alloys e.g. due to their ferromagnetic behavior a similar set of attraction experiments was performed on a tailored copper ingot containing Cu Re Ag and Au. Sulfur attraction was achieved on multiple surfaces in this instance the top and the bottom.

In yet another set of experiments to investigate the behavior of tailored ingots that are ferromagnetic in their natural state i.e. can be induced to have a magnetic field through the alignment of magnetic moments using a natural magnet a tailored cobalt alloy ingot Co V Re Ingot 14 01 20 was tested for material attraction immediately following the end of the tailoring process. The manufactured Co V Re ingot did attract iron immediately following the tailoring process in limited regions.

Given these positive attraction testing results further tests were performed on the tailored copper and copper alloy non ferromagnetic ingots. These non ferromagnetic materials should not attract either a magnet or iron in their natural state. Yet each of the manufactured copper ingots attracted spherical sponge iron 99.8 pure 50 to 100 mesh . Ingots 14 04 05 14 04 03 14 02 06 all exhibited a fairly random patterning sprinkling of attraction while ingot 14 03 02 appears to have definite lines of attraction.

In a natural material the attraction of a magnet or ferromagnet is accompanied by the appearance of a magnetic field caused by the alignment of magnetic moments in the magnetic or ferromagnetic material creating a measurable field strength magnetic density or magnetic flux . Since each of these tailored materials exhibited an attraction to a Nd Fe B magnet and many attracted ferromagnetic iron Gauss readings were taken at designated intervals across the ingot surface to observe any potential magnetic fields using an F. W. Bell 4048 Gauss Meter . The detailed magnetic grids obtained from such testing may be found in Appendix 3. The results are summarized in Table 4 below.

While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims.
