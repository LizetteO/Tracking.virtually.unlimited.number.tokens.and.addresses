title: Dynamically updating a websheet configuration
abstract: A system and computer program product for updating a configuration of a websheet. A client receives a web page including the websheet from a server. The websheet includes data values stored in a relational database table. The table includes a first set of data values displayed in cells of the websheet in response to the client receiving the web page. The table also includes a second set of data values associated with the websheet configuration. Second set data values are not displayed in the websheet in response to the client receiving the web page. A form displaying the second set is received by the client. Second set data values are updated on the form to provide an updated websheet configuration. With its updated configuration, the websheet is displayed at the client and allows data entry to modify or add first set data values.
