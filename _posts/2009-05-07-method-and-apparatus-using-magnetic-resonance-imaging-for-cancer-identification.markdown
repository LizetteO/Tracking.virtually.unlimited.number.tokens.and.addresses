Embodiments herein relate to identification of cancer and more specifically to methods and apparatus using magnetic resonance imaging for cancer identification.

Screening for breast cancer represents one of modern medicine s success stories. However the continued large fraction of false positives in current diagnostic protocols often leads to biopsy pathology procedures that cause considerable pain anxiety healthcare cost and possibly increased malignancy risk but which are potentially avoidable. To address this problem there have been recent calls for the increased use of magnetic resonance imaging MRI in breast screening.

The problems associated with false positive results are not unique to breast cancer screening. Other cancers suffer from large numbers of false positive results causing significant stress as well as often requiring additional costly and painful procedures to confirm or deny the initial results.

In exemplary embodiments a computing device may be endowed with one or more components of the disclosed apparatuses and or systems and may be employed to perform one or more methods as disclosed herein.

Embodiments herein provide a Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI technique and optionally newly developed software collectively referred to as the shutter speed model to analyze image data of cancer patients. Embodiments provide a minimally invasive yet precisely accurate approach to determining whether tumors are malignant or benign. Exemplary embodiments provide MRI measured biomarkers for tumor malignancy determination effectively solving the false positive riddle from which current MRI techniques suffer.

Although some embodiments throughout are described with reference to breast cancer or prostate cancer the methods and apparatuses described herein may be utilized for other cancers such as brain esophageal leg osteosarcoma etc. as well as for any Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging DCE MRI analysis where water exchange effects are relevant including tissue differential disease state analysis of the brain Alzheimers MS etc. muscles such as heart etc. and quantitative vascular phenotype mapping.

 Quantitative MRI produces parametric maps of MR patho physiological and or pharmacokinetic biomarker properties. The DCE MRI sub category is particularly significant because it applies to a wide pathology range. In DCE MRI the T weighted tissue HO MRI signal intensity is acquired before during and after the usually bolus injection of a hydrophilic paramagnetic contrast reagent CR . The CR passage through a tissue region of interest ROI can cause a transient increase of the longitudinal HO relaxation rate constant R T with consequent elevated MR steady state signal intensity. This elevation may be identified on the MR image.

In DCE MRI the neglect of intercompartmental water exchange kinetics considerations can lead to systematic errors in parameters extracted by quantitative analyses. Examples here are the compartmental water mole fractions defining tissue spaces. Therefore DCE MRI is also a sub category of in vivo MR molecular imaging mapping the distribution and or activity of molecules in living tissues.

In essence in embodiments the CR plays the role of the nuclear medicine radioactive tracer. However in nuclear medicine the tracer is detected directly by its radioactivity in disintegrations per second dps the amount of tracer present in the tissue but compartmental localization is not intrinsic to the signal . In contrast the MRI CR is detected indirectly via its interaction with water and effect on the nature of tissue HO relaxation so the water interaction with the CR is what is directly traced . Beneficially the CR is not radioactive. Also MRI involves no ionizing radiation.

Affecting the recovery of longitudinal HO magnetization i.e. in the magnetic field direction requires transient water CR molecular interaction as depicted in . The three major loci for tissue water the cytoplasmae the interstitium and the blood are indicated with subscripts i o or e and b p for plasma respectively. There are water binding equilibria depicted in each compartment in which the CR is thought to enter. The compartmental volume fractions are designated as v v and v respectively though the relative areas in are not proportional.

The CR and water molecules are never equally distributed in tissue. Therefore the only way that most water cytoplasmic can access CR is via exchange equilibria across cytolemmae and blood vessel walls. These are indicated in with the unidirectional rate constants k k and k k respectively. In existing methods tracer pharmacokinetic models are applied directly to MRI data such methods are referred to here as the Standard Model SM . However this results in the constraint that all inter compartmental equilibrium water exchange processes be treated as if infinitely fast k k and k k . This is not valid and the assumption may effectively short circuit MRI determination of CR compartmentalization the pharmacokinetic essence. In accordance with embodiments herein the incorporation of equilibrium water exchange MR effects into pharmacokinetic derivation is referred to herein as the Shutter Speed Model SSM . This is accomplished by allowing k kand k kto be finite.

The SM assumes that water exchange between cells and or blood and the interstitial spaces is effectively infinitely fast in the fast exchange limit FXL . However when CR is passing through the tumor tissue the water exchange systems can depart from this fast exchange limit due to the interaction with the CR and therefore enter into a fast exchange regime FXR . This happens for both benign and malignant tumors however the exchange difference between FXL and FXR as far as Kis concerned is significantly greater for malignant tumors as opposed to benign tumors. For benign tumors the exchange difference is typically below 0.025 min whereas for malignant tumors the exchange difference is typically above 0.025 min. This differentiating line provides a threshold against which the obtained values may be compared to classify a tumor or tissue sample. In embodiments a threshold may be established at an exchange difference delta K of 0.02 to 0.03 min.

While a single threshold is mentioned above in embodiments more than one delta Kthreshold may be established. For example a first threshold may be established that is intended to include all or a substantial percentage of the malignant tissues above the threshold. A secondary threshold may be established at a lower delta Kvalue with an intention of included all true positive indicators. However a lower threshold may introduce a larger number of false positives. For a tissue having a delta Kvalue residing between the first and second threshold additional analysis may be utilized to further classify the tissue.

In an embodiment the shutter speed model SSM accounts for the FXR therefore including equilibrium exchange effects when the CR passes through and thus is better able to pick up the leaky blood vessel effect which is common in malignant tumors. At a maximum level of CR in the interstitial space an interstitial water molecule in a benign lesion may typically encounter a CR molecule an average of 60 times before it enters a cell whereas in a malignant tumor this may happen 260 times on average 4 times as often . If that difference is neglected which the standard model does then it is sufficient to cause significant K the volume weighted CR extravasation rate constant underestimations in malignant tumors. Because Kvalues are greater for malignant tissues than for benign tissues if Kis underestimated then it may make a malignant tumor seem benign false negative or vice versa a benign tissue appear to be malignant false positive . The SSM model accounts for this difference and by using the delta K change in K as well as the Kto kcomparison classification of tumors may be accomplished. In accordance with an embodiment kis the unidirectional CR intravasation rate constant it is Kdivided by the v the extracellular extravascular volume fraction available to the contrast agent molecule . The pharmacokinetic analysis of DCE MRI data yields Kand k.

In accordance with an embodiment the difference in Kreturned by SSM as compared to the Standard Model analyses offers a very high degree of tumor differentiation i.e. specificity . It is a measure of the shutter speed effect which is disproportionally present and important in malignant tumors that permits differentiation of benign and malignant tumors. The increased permeability of malignant tumor blood vessels exceeds a threshold above which exchange kinetics become influential. This amplification is measured by the delta Kbiomarker and accounts for the high SSM specificity.

In analyses of DCE MRI data from patients with suspicious breast lesions initially ruled positive by institutional screening protocols the SM Kvalues for benign and malignant lesions exhibit considerable overlap. The Shutter Speed Model SSM may allow for finite exchange kinetics thus agreeing with the SM Kvalue for each of the benign lesions. However it reveals that the SM underestimates Kfor each of the malignant tumors in this population. illustrates Kvalues obtained by both SM and SSM and shows how SSM recognizes a difference in Kbetween benign and malignant tissue. The fact that this phenomenon is unique to malignant tumors allows their discrimination from the benign lesions as validated by comparison with gold standard pathology analyses of subsequent biopsy tissue samples to which the MRI analyses were blinded. Likewise the SM overestimates k particularly for the benign tumors. Thus incorporation of the SSM into the screening protocols may preclude the need for the biopsy pathology procedures that otherwise would yield benign findings.

1. deltaK the change in K thresholds may be established with the goal intention of including all true positives. Thresholds may be established as desired to distinguish classify the tissues tumors. In an embodiment further analysis may be conducted via a secondary mapping algorithm plot of KVS. k to allow for a second determination with respect to those points that are somewhat unclear or fall below a determined threshold.

2. The use of 2D plots Kvs. k where the radius of a circle centered at the origin of the plot may be used as a binary classifier. In embodiments the radius of the circle may be used as a threshold to distinguish benign from malignant tumors. Such a threshold may be established at approximately 0.2 min for example from 0.19 minto 0.25 min.

In embodiments an MRI examination aided by SSM analysis may provide a clearer diagnosis and may be an intermediate step between a mammographic scan and a biopsy intervention if breast cancer is suspected from both the mammogram and the MRI results. Adding this intermediate diagnostic step may greatly reduce or eliminate the number of unnecessary and possibly all biopsy surgeries and also reduce the pain stress and expense for most patients.

It is important to note that the SSM is a generalization of the SM. That is the SM is but a special case of the SSM. Thus if the shutter speed effect is negligible in any tissue the program will automatically perform a SM analysis. One can test this by computationally constraining the SSM analysis to a SM form. If there is no difference from the result obtained when the SSM analysis is given free rein then there is no significant shutter speed effect for that tissue. In the case of breast tumors this is the case for the Kbiomarker in only benign lesions. However there is a shutter speed effect for the vbiomarker in benign breast lesions and it is about the same size as in malignant tumors.

To test SSM SSM was employed to analyze MR images of 22 women volunteers who had previously screened positive for breast cancer by mammography and or clinical examination. The shutter speed software operates by using a complex mathematical formula to track the passage of injected contrast dye through a tumor area. Contrast dyes are commonly used in medical imaging to increase the visibility of tissue abnormalities.

When viewed through the shutter speed analysis the MRI data suggested that only seven of the 22 women actually had malignant tumors. These projections were later shown to be 100 percent accurate after each of the study participants underwent subsequent biopsies for pathology determinations. Typically 75 percent of mammographically indicated biopsies yield negative pathology results meaning that an intermediate step such as an MRI determination could greatly reduce or eliminate the number of unnecessary biopsy surgeries.

This population study has been expanded to include 77 breast tumors in 74 patients and with the mapping provision for one rare type of malignant tumor maintains 100 specificity. illustrates delta Kresults of the 74 patient data set illustrating 77 lesions.

In addition illustrates the multiple threshold concept described previously. The first threshold is intended to capture all or a substantial percentage of the malignant tissues above the threshold. The first delta Kthreshold may be set for example between 0.02 minand 0.03 min. The secondary threshold is established at a lower delta Kvalue with an intention of included all true positive indicators. The second delta Kthreshold may be set for example between 0.01 minand 0.02 min. For a tissue having a delta Kvalue residing between the first and second threshold additional analysis may be utilized to further classify the tissue. Such analysis may include heat map analysis of regions of interest to better classify the tissue.

For the more limited data set 22 patients data were obtained with consent from patients with positive mammographic and or clinical MRI reports from standard institutional breast cancer workups and protocols. All had MRI contrast enhanced lesions radiologically classified as BIRADS Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System four B 4 suspicious or five B 5 highly suggestive of malignancy . Emphasizing practicability and robustness the data are of a rather routine clinical nature and they were obtained at two different institutions with two different instruments CRs etc. the two different data acquisitions were not optimized for DCE MRI. For example though the spatial resolution is reasonable the temporal resolution is not optimal. Of particular interest is the fact that the adipose tissue HC MR signal was suppressed in the acquisitions at one institution while at the other institution it was not.

Additional DCE MRI acquisition details may be found in Li et al. Dynamic NMR Effects in Breast Cancer Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI PNAS Vol. 105 No. 46 17937 17942 2008 and Supporting Online Material the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. For each of the 22 subjects ROI DCE MRI time course data were analyzed from one sagittal image slice out of 16 to 40 per breast that exhibited a lesion to be subsequently biopsied. An ROI boundary was manually drawn around the entire lesion in a pharmacokinetic image showing near maximal enhancement as in . The patients are enumerated in Table 1 below. The images are from patient 3. The DCE MRI time courses were each analyzed with several pharmacokinetic models.

For the patients results presented in Table 1 ROI boundaries around each lesion were separately drawn by each of two independent investigators who were blinded to the pathology results. The analyses of these ROI data were also conducted independently by two investigators. The algebraic means of the model parameters returned from each investigator s fitting were computed lesion by lesion.

Each of the fittings neglects the small blood water proton signal HO thus these are first generation versions. For this situation the MR exchange system of interest is that for equilibrium transcytolemmal water interchange k and k . The system s condition is given by the comparison of the equilibrium kinetics k K k with the pertinent MR shutter speed T R R where Rand Rare the relaxation rate constants for the HOand HOsignals in the absence of exchange.

Table 1 indicates that the SM does not completely separate the malignant tumors top seven entries from the benign lesions with either the Kor kparameters. However the SSM significantly increases Kfor every one of the malignant lesions and for none of the benign tumors as compared to the SM. Furthermore though the SSM reduces kfor both malignant and benign lesions it does this more for the benign tumors. In embodiments these changes allow discrimination between the SSM and SM results.

Though neither of the parameters allows the construction of perfect ROC Receiver Operator Characteristic plots the SSM Kand kquantities come very close. These aspects may be seen in the 2D parametric scatter plots of the K ordinate and k abscissa values presented in . The ROI values for lesions found by pathology analyses Table 1 to be solely benign are indicated with triangles while those with major malignant regions are shown as black circles. The two gray circles with black cores also represent malignant tumors and are discussed below. The results from the SM FXL c analyses are seen in panel a while those from the SSM FXR a determinations are shown in panel b. The values for patient 5 are so large that they are shown in inset panel c and inset panel d.

In comparing with one can note especially the upward movement increasing K of the circles and the leftward movement decreasing k of the triangles in going from the SM to the SSM. This allows the almost complete separation of these points in which is not achieved in any single dimension of either panel. It is important to note that two of the triangles represent B 5 lesions Table 1 i.e. they were highly suggestive false positives. Retaining 100 sensitivity not missing any malignant tumor the PPV values for the SM K SM k SSM K and SSM kdimensions are 54 39 70 and 70 respectively. In the SSM 2D plot one can draw a dashed quarter circle of radius 0.19 min that also allows a 78 PPV.

Furthermore consider the annular region between this and the other concentric quarter circle of radius 0.23 min. The only two malignant tumors circles with dark cores within are those of patients 3 upper and 7 lower . These are cases where the malignant areas are quite small compared with the total tumor area visualized in the biopsy specimen Table 1 . This means that the analyses of whole tumor ROI averaged data cause a partial volume dilution of the DCE MRI parametric values. This can be seen clearly in panels b and c of which present Kparametric heat maps of the lesion of patient 3. In the SM FXL c and SSM FXR a maps panels b and c respectively a clear hot spot is seen on the posterior lesion edge. The hot spot has Kvalues above 0.16 minin the FXR a map considerably elevated above the ROI averaged magnitude Table 1 .

The hot regions of all seven malignant tumors in this population have SSM Kvalues exceeding 0.1 min. Except for that of patient 17 upper triangle in annulus and which uniquely exhibits ductal dilation Table 1 this exceeds the ROI averaged SSM Kvalues of any of the fifteen benign lesions. With and parametric maps heat maps of four of the seven malignant tumors have been presented in several publications referenced below. Some hot spots can be as small as 2 mm in diameter. In another indication of potential staging power a plot not shown of hotness vs. area of the SSM Khot spots in the malignant tumors of patients 5 6 and 7 demonstrates that these two independently measured quantities are very highly positively correlated. The fact that the SXR a Kmap of the patient 3 lesion does not show increased values relative to the FXL c map and in fact obliterates the hot spot is an example of the SXR a model incompatibility with these data.

The Kand kvalues are rather well correlated in particularly in panel b. The positions of the panel a and b insets are placed with constant coordinate aspect ratios. Thus one can visually include the inset points in the correlations. The slope of a line drawn through the points represents the mean vvalue of these lesions. Such a line for has a slope near 0.5.

These results suggest a potential breast cancer screening protocol in accordance with an embodiment herein. The first step of such a protocol would be a clinical examination and or mammography. A positive result B 4 or B 5 or suspicion of a mammographically occult lesion would occasion referral for diagnostic MRI that includes DCE. The radiologist can circumscribe an ROI from the DCE image showing the greatest enhancement. Alternatively this can be automated ex. Jim 4.0 software Xinapse Systems Thorpe Waterville UK . The computer can very quickly few seconds conduct SM and SSM analyses on the mean ROI signal time course data and produce SSM Kand kvalues which can be compared with 2D scatter plots such as those in . If a patient s point turns out to be in the annulus between the quarter circles in the radiologist could proceed to read Kparametric lesion maps made from the same DCR MRI data though these require more computational time. Hot spots above 0.1 minwould be very suspicious for malignancy.

Some oncologists advocate a separate regimen for a malignant ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS tumor possibly simply following it instead of immediate surgery while others urge excision. The only solely DCIS case in the discussed patient population is that of patient 1. Her position in is the black point closest to the outer quarter circle. In fact another concentric quarter circle of radius 0.3 minwould isolate this point. Its position could be followed or tracked over a period of time to see if it moves up and to the right. Inside the inner quarter circle most of the benign LCIS lesions are found in the upper right sector while all of the FA lesions are found near the bottom.

In the analyses so far pseudo absolute parameter values have been employed. The SSM success suggests that neglect of equilibrium transcytolemmal water exchange effects may constitute the most significant systematic error in Standard Model DCE MRI pharmacokinetic analyses.

For screening purposes the most striking aspect of the Table 1 and results is that every one of the malignant tumor ROI Kvalues dark circles is clearly decreased by the SM analysis while every one of the benign lesion ROI values triangles is not. This is seen even more clearly in which presents the 1D scatter plot for K K SSM K SM . There is a wide gap between all seven of the dark circles group mean 0.06 min 1 excluding the inset point and all 15 of the triangles. The latter set clusters very near zero group mean 0.006 min 1 . A clean cut off line is drawn at 0.024 min. Since the only difference between these two models is the allowance for the effect on the NMR signal of finite equilibrium transcytolemmal water exchange kinetics the NMR shutter speed effect this suggests that it is significant for the Kmagnitude with the capillary wall permeability obtained for the vascular beds of only malignant breast tumors. Thus this is very encouraging that analyses of DCE MRI ROI data first with one pharmacokinetic model and then with the other which is still accomplished in only seconds can lead to extremely high specificity in cancer screening. Here the positive criterion of K 0.025 minyields 100 PPV.

Apparently in the vascular beds of malignant breast tumors only the interstitial outside CR concentration CR transiently rises to sufficient values during the bolus passage and the equilibrium transcytolemmal water exchange system transiently departs the FXL to sufficient extent and or for sufficient duration to substantially invalidate the SM Kdetermination. The SSM interpretation is that during the bolus passage through malignant lesions the relaxographic Tvalue for the transcytolemmal water exchange process R R transiently approaches or exceeds that for the unchanging exchange rate constant k k in vivo studies are isothermal sufficiently for the system to enter at least the fast exchange regime FXR but probably not also the slow exchange regime SXR . Rincreases with CR while R remains constant. This is a manifestation of the varying equilibrium competition for interstitial water molecules between diamagnetic cytoplasmic spaces and paramagnetic interstitial CR molecules . Informative estimates can be made by comparison of the Table 1 patients 8 4 benign malignant lesion pair with SSM K0.034 and 0.254 min respectively. For one of the SSM FXR a fittings of each the v parameters returned are similar 0.60 0.40 s and 0.69 0.39 s for benign and malignant respectively. Thus the unidirectional rate constants for water cellular entry k v 1 are similar 1.7 and 1.2 s respectively constant and not infinitely large. However before the arrival of interstitial CR the transcytolemmal water exchange appears infinitely fast in the NMR signal because Tis almost negligible. The interstitial water molecules encounter no paramagnetic CRmolecules before entering a diamagnetic cytoplasm. However as CRincreases the rate constant for interstitial water CR encounter CR HO also increases kin . While for the benign lesion CRmaximizes at 0.52 mM at 7.5 minutes this is 1.6 mM at 3.5 minutes for the malignant tumor. Thus CR max HO values are 104 and 313 sfor the benign and malignant lesions respectively. The interstitial water concentration HO was 50 M and the mean water lifetime on the CR was 10s. At maximum CR an interstitial water molecule in the benign lesion encounters a paramagnetic CR molecule on average 60 times 104 1.7 before it enters a diamagnetic cell sufficient apparently for the SM 40 vunderestimation. While in the malignant tumor this happens 260 times 313 1.2 on average more than four times as often. This is sufficient to cause significant Kunderestimations if it is neglected.

For the expanded data set a total of 74 patients underwent clinical breast MRI protocols and had 77 contrast enhanced lesions 3 patients presented 2 lesions each radiologically classified in the BIRADS Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4 B 4 suspicious n 67 or 5 B 5 highly suggestive of malignancy n 10 categories based on lesion morphology and qualitative enhancement kinetics assessment. These clinical interpretations led to biopsy referrals. The research DCE MRI data acquisitions were IRB approved. The data from 6 patients were collected as part of a combined MRI MRS protocol prior to excisional or core biopsy. Those from the other 68 patients 71 lesions were acquired during clinically scheduled MRI guided preoperative needle localization or core biopsy procedures just before needle insertions.

The study was conducted at 1.5T using a body transmit and a four or seven channel phased array bilateral breast receive RF coils. A 3D SPGR pulse sequence was used to acquire 12 20 serial sagittal image volume sets continually spatially covering the whole breast with the suspicious lesion to be biopsied. Other parameters included 10 or 30 for the 6 patients flip angle 2 5 ms TE 6 9 ms TR 3 mm section thickness 20 24 cm FOV. Depending on the breast size 16 36 image sections were acquired for each set resulting in inter sampling intervals of 13 42 seconds. At the start of the second volume set acquisition Gd CR was delivered intravenously 0.1 mmol kg at 2 mL s . ROIs circumscribing the enhanced lesion and within an axillary artery produced the tumor signal intensity and arterial input function AIF time courses respectively. Three reliable individual AIFs were measured which were interpolated with an empirical expression 3 and averaged to generate a mean AIF. The tumor ROI and mean AIF signal time courses were then subjected to both SM and fast exchange regime allowed SSM analyses which were blinded from the pathology. Receiver operating characteristic ROC curves were used to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter diagnostic accuracies and the areas under the curve AUCs were compared using a Bootstrap nonparametric test.

Upon pathology only 18 lesions 10 B 4 and 8 B 5 were found malignant and the other 59 57 B 4 and 2 B 5 benign. Though the clinical MRI protocol sensitivity is 100 no false negatives its PPV is only 23 . The SSM KROC AUC 0.973 is significantly p 0.032 greater than that for the SM K 0.929 . Similar results were obtained for other strong biomarkers k K v the unidirectional CR intravasation rate constant SSM AUC 0.960 SM AUC 0.861 p 0.006 and K k SSM AUC 0.970 SM AUC 0.887 p 0.009 . Maintaining 100 sensitivity the diagnostic specificities of the SM ROI K k and K k are 47 42 and 51 while those for the corresponding SSM parameters are 76 61 and 75 respectively each biomarker used as a binary classifier. The SM and SSM vROC curve AUCs are 0.555 and 0.615 respectively suggesting that vis a poor diagnostic marker.

The SSM DCE MRI ROI pharmacokinetic parameters consistently perform better than those from SM DCE MRI and the commonly used clinical MRI protocols for benign and malignant discrimination within this group of 77 suspicious breast lesions. If the simple ROI delta Kanalyses had been integrated into clinical practice as many as 52 benign lesions 68 of the total population could have been spared the biopsy procedures. As expected from the earlier study the malignant lesions cluster almost exclusively on the left of while the benign lesions are almost all to the right the axes are independent. The solid cut off line value delta K 0.028 min is very close to that for 100 specificity in the smaller population. It yields only one false positive the sole tubular adenoma and one false negative the sole ILC lesion. A more lenient dashed cut off line can be drawn at delta K 0.012 minto avoid any false negative and still incur only 14 benign biopsies. But even these might be avoided. The likely reason for a malignant lesion ROI delta Kto fall between the solid and dashed cut off lines is because of partial volume averaging in the ROI analyses. Consistent with this the ILC had the very large value of 5 cm as the greatest enhanced ROI dimension. Its pixel by pixel SSM Kmap not shown features hot spots K 0.18 min only in the posterior rim region. Though these are diluted by a very large area of small Kvalues in the ROI they confirm the lesion as malignant. This suggests that delta Kor SSM Kmaps parametric heat maps should be made when an ROI delta Kfalls between the solid and dashed lines.

Other analysis methods may be used to further distinguish the data such as points falling between delta Kthresholds. For example the median Kdifference delta median K SSM median K SM median K may be plotted ordinate vs. the change in maximum histographic probability amplitude abscissa delta Amp SSM amplitude SM amplitude . Such an operation indicates a significant negative linear correlation Pearson correlation 0.82 p 0.0018 for the benign lesions while the malignant lesions exhibit an almost orthogonal correlation. The ILC identified for example in cannot be distinguished from the benign group with simple ROI delta Kanalyses. However using quadratic discrimination analysis the benign and malignant lesions can be completely separated 100 sensitivity and 100 specificity by the solid partition curve with no misclassification.

Though the ROI delta Kbiomarker achieves high specificity for benign malignant breast lesion discrimination the partial volume averaging effects of ROI analyses can cause overlap in ROI pharmacokinetic parameter values and thus prevent clearer separation of the two groups. Pharmacokinetic parametric mapping and histogram analyses thus may further improve discrimination. Such analyses are especially important when the lesion ROI biomarker value falls in the vicinity of a binary classifier cut off value. Thus it is beneficial to acquire DCE MRI data with sufficient SNR since this ensures reliable pixel signal time course curve fitting. The negative linear correlation of the benign lesions and the orthogonal behavior of the malignant lesions are quite interesting. Compared to malignant lesions that can have noticeable median Kincreases shutter speed SS histographic shifts without significant histographic maximum probability changes SS broadening the areas in benign lesions where increased blood vessel CR permeability incurs SS effects if any are smaller. Considerable SS histographic broadening is associated with even minuscule SS histographic shifting.

In accordance with embodiments herein certain steps may be taken even in the clinical setting to improve the precision the accuracy and or the diagnostic richness of the SSM DCE MRI pharmacokinetic parameters. Such modifications may for example decrease the random error scatter in the point clusters. This may allow further discrimination of pathology sub types.

The DCE MRI time course acquisitions discussed herein were prescribed for radiological considerations and were truncated. Increasing this period would likely improve accuracy and precision of the benign lesion parameters. For these ROIs the maximum Rvalue is rarely reached in the no more than seven minutes usually allowed. This is the likely source of abnormally large vvalues for some benign tumors. Increasing the period to 15 minutes may help define the shape of the time course even for malignant tumors.

The DCE MRI acquisitions for the data described herein were not particularly exchange sensitive. Even so exchange effects seem to facilitate very high discrimination of malignant from benign breast tumors.

The tissue Rvalues the pre CR HO longitudinal relaxation rate constants may be mapped and not simply assumed as they were herein. Individual AIFs may be used as well. A reference tissue method or an automated AIF determination ex. Jim 4.0 software Xinapse Systems Thorpe Waterville UK may be used.

Increased temporal resolution may be achieved without sacrificing spatial resolution or signal to noise. Parallel RF excitation acquisition may be useful for achieving such increased temporal resolution. With good definition of the DCE time course first pass leading edge the second generation SSM BALDERO Blood Agent Level Dependent and Extravasation Relaxation Overview analysis which accounts for blood HO signal pharmacokinetic behavior may be used to also determine vand kvalues. It is anticipated that tumor vvalues will have significant diagnostic value. Furthermore vkis the transendothelial water permeability coefficient surface area product PS where S is the total capillary bed surface area. The ratio PS PS would be the intensive property P P. The value of the CR permeability coefficient surface area product PS may be factored from the Kparameter using the blood flow value which may also be determined from DCE MRI data.

Image acquisition without HC suppression may yield signal intensities much more amenable to precision parametric mapping. The maps require sufficient acquisition contrast to noise ratio because pixel by pixel analytical modeling is more susceptible to noise. However care must be taken to avoid contamination of HO by unsuppressed HC .

In embodiments the shutter speed model may be enhanced by adding a factor for putative T transverse relaxation signal quenching. In an embodiment there is provided a direct application of a T reduction factor to the interstitial water signal in the Ernstian MR steady state DCE MRI model expression. Assuming the greatest T reduction will return Kand vvalues for the tumor region of interest about 35 and 15 greater respectively than one would find when ignoring this effect. For normal appearing tissues these are 11 and 17 greater respectively. Thus applying the factor further distinguishes normal tissue from the tumor ROI. illustrates this relationship.

The SXR a SSM includes T neglect and therefore underestimates Kand vto the extent that there is a disproportionate relaxation of compartmental water signals. Embodiments herein provide a way of testing to see if the blood and interstitial water signals have been edited from the detected signal that is SXR a is inappropriate .

DCE MRI pharmacokinetic modeling usually ignores potential HO signal reduction due to transverse relaxation T effects. Most clinical DCE MRI applications employ a contrast reagent CR dose of 0.1 mmol kg which may produce a blood plasma CR concentration above 5.0 mM at its peak during the bolus passage. Here using exemplary prostate DCE MRI data a potential T effect on DCE MRI model parameter values is described by using a water exchange shutter speed model along with a simplified factor to account for putative T signal quenching.

Prostate HO MRI data were acquired with a Siemens TIM Trio 3T system under an IRB approved protocol. RF transmitting was through the whole body coil and RF receiving was with a combination of Spine Matrix and flexible Body Matrix RF coils. The DCE MRI sequence employed a 3D TurboFLASH sequence with a 256 144 16 matrix size and a 360 203 mmfield of view resulting in an in plane resolution of 1.4 1.4 mm. Other parameters are slice thickness 3 mm TR TE FA 5.42 ms 1.56 ms 15 imaging intersampling interval 4.16 seconds. Any T induced signal reduction is assumed to be proportional to exp r CR R TE applying to the HO signal from the CR occupied compartment. For the data here the most influential CR containing compartment is the prostate interstitium. Thus r and CR represent the interstitial CR transverse relaxivity and concentration respectively. Since susceptibility effects cross compartmental boundaries surely r also has a contribution from capillary blood plasma CR. This T reduction factor is then directly applied to the interstitial HO signal in the Ernstian MR steady state DCE MRI model expression. Parameter uncertainties were determined with sets of Monte Carlo simulations carried out for each ROI averaged HO signal with increasing T quenching accounted for by choosing an increasing r value mMs 0 no quenching 5 a literature value 20 an estimated blood plasma value at 3T or 40. For each r and each ROI data set 200 simulation runs were performed with Gaussian noise 0 0.08 directly added to the normalized ROI data time course. This resulted in a simulated time course with a signal to noise ratio SNR slightly better than that from a single pixel. Random initial guess values were evenly distributed within the parameter space for each simulation fitting.

The analysis used here is based on an inherently three site model but multi step recursive fittings would eventually return a zero within error blood volume fraction v for the tumor tissue. This is not because vis actually zero but only because it is indeterminate due to the very CR permeable capillary wall. The blood HO signal makes a contribution indistinguishable from that of the EES. Thus it may be better to use an only two site model. For consistency the same two site model is also used for the normal appearing tissue ROI. The current analysis is conservative in estimating EES signal T quenching effects. Interestingly however the extracted parameters move exactly in the direction seen comparing analyses with the fast exchange regime FXR allowed two site shutter speed model with the slow exchange regime SXR allowed version. The former neglects a distinguishable interstitial HO signal contribution which is reduced by exchange and may also be at least partially T quenched. For a tumor blood volume estimation using DCE MRI with extravasating CR it is prudent to use a lower CR dose.
