title: Generalized midcourse missile guidance
abstract: A method for guiding a multistage interceptor missile toward a target missile that may transition from a boost mode to a ballistic mode during the engagement. The method comprises the steps of tracking the position of the target missile with a sensor, generating a predicted intercept point and time, and loading the predicted intercept point and time into the interceptor missile guidance system. The interceptor missile is launched and transition is made to the second stage of propulsion of the interceptor missile. Second-stage midcourse guidance acceleration commands are generated in response to an elevated predicted intercept point generated using the Runge-Kutta integration method working on predicted target missile position, velocity, and acceleration. During third stage propulsion said interceptor missile is guided toward an updated predicted intercept point of the target missile. During fourth stage, the kinetic warhead effects a hit-to-kill intercept of the target missile.

This invention was made with government support under Contract Grant Aegis BMD N00024 03 C 6110. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The Missile Defense Agency MDA is tasked to develop an integrated layered Ballistic Missile Defense System BMDS to defend the United States its deployed forces allies and friends from ballistic missile attack. The MDA BMDS strategy covers all phases of target ballistic missile flight including boost midcourse and terminal. The current Aegis BMD supports the MDA goal by providing hit to kill interceptor missile engagement capability against target ballistic missiles in the midcourse phase. Fielded capability of the current Aegis BMD does not launch against or intercept target missiles while in their boost phase.

When launching an interceptor missile such as the four stage Standard Missile 3 SM 3 from an Aegis firing ship against a hostile missile the first stage is launched in the direction of the predicted intercept point of the target missile. The second stage is guided using midcourse guidance to a waypoint which defines the end of the second stage of guidance and is consistent with an updated predicted intercept point calculated by the Aegis Weapon System AWS assuming a ballistic target trajectory target missile is under the influence of only gravitational forces . The third stage is guided to the updated predicted intercept point using inertial guidance performed by the interceptor missile. Terminal guidance of the SM 3 interceptor missile is performed by the fourth stage kinetic warhead using a modified version of proportional navigation to effect a hit to kill intercept of the target missile.

The current second stage midcourse guidance may not be fully effective against a boosting target missile and improved midcourse guidance is desired which is generalized in the sense that engagements of both boosting and ballistic target missiles are facilitated.

A method according to an aspect of the invention is for guiding a multistage interceptor missile toward a target missile where the target missile may transition from a boost mode to a ballistic mode during the engagement. The method comprises the steps of tracking the position of the target missile with a sensor to determine its location generating a pre interceptor missile launch predicted intercept point and predicted intercept time and loading the predicted intercept point PIP and time into the interceptor missile guidance system. The interceptor missile is launched and the first stage guidance is controlled at least in response to the target missile bearing and elevation toward the predicted intercept point. A transition is made to the second stage of propulsion of the interceptor missile. Second stage midcourse guidance of the interceptor missile is controlled in response to second stage midcourse guidance acceleration commands which may be generated by the firing Aegis ship. Second stage midcourse guidance acceleration commands are generated in response to an elevated predicted intercept point. The elevated predicted intercept point is generated by adjusting a predicted intercept point to account for the effects of interceptor missile velocity at waypoint interceptor missile propulsion beyond second stage and gravity between the waypoint and the PIP. The predicted intercept point is generated using the Runge Kutta integration method working on predicted target missile position velocity and acceleration. A transition is made to third stage propulsion of the interceptor missile and the interceptor missile is guided toward an updated predicted intercept point of the target missile. A transition is made to the fourth stage kinetic warhead to effect a hit to kill intercept of the target missile.

In a particular mode of the method the step of generating the generalized midcourse guidance acceleration commands in response to an elevated predicted intercept point generated using the Runge Kutta integration method includes the steps of 

This mode of the method also includes following the step of generating the initial second stage acceleration commands iteratively repeating the steps of 

Boost phase missile defense is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 430 644 filed May 9 2006 in the name of Pedersen and U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 394 047 7 473 876 and 7 511 252 to Pedersen. As described in these references defenses against ballistic missiles are currently concentrating upon the boost phase of the ballistic missile which is a phase at which multiple warheads and or countermeasures have not as yet been deployed. Intercepting a ballistic missile before it can deploy complicated countermeasures and or multiple warheads greatly decreases the burden on sensors to distinguish lethal payload object s from countermeasures. Boost phase launches involve having interceptor assets at a location or locations near the expected launch sites of threatening offensive ballistic missiles sensing the presence of the threat missile soon after launch calculating its expected trajectory timely launching interceptor asset s to intercept the threat missile and guiding the interceptor missile to its target. It will be understood that initially a defender sensing the launch of a ballistic missile does not know exactly when it was launched the type of missile which has been launched although there may be some knowledge of the missile types available at the launch site its mass thrust and intended trajectory. In fact very little is initially known. Unlike engagements of threat missiles in their mid course phase where the trajectory of such threat missiles is well defined by Keplerian orbits uncertainty in the trajectory of a boosting missile is a major challenge in defeating such a threat missile.

Launching against threat missiles in their boost phase requires methods to filter sensor measurements and establish track states to determine the type of a threat missile to propagate the threat missile s state into the future to plan an engagement against the threat missile and to guide an interceptor to destroy the threat missile. An engagement planner for boost phase interceptor launches must weigh the capability of the interceptor against the uncertainty in the trajectory of the boosting threat missile.

The problem of defense against a boosting threat missile is further exacerbated by the lack of knowledge of the threat missile s trajectory as one can only plan an interceptor missile launch if one knows which interceptor missile among several is in a position from which and has capabilities such that it can be expected to make a successful interception. When generalized midcourse guidance according to an aspect of the invention is used for the second stage guidance together with the current 3and 4stage guidance of the SM 3 the SM 3 may be launched against a boosting target missile and can be expected to intercept that missile in its ballistic phase.

The operation of the logic of begins with the sensing of a boost phase ballistic missile soon after launch. Sensing immediately at launch is not possible with a surface based sensor because the curvature of the Earth prevents it from observing the actual launch. The delay between launch and first sensing depends upon the acceleration of the missile the immediate topology around the launch site and the sensing location and the distance between the launch site and the sensor location but may be about 25 seconds or more. An Overhead Non imaging Infrared ONIR sensor on the other hand can produce results instantaneously or with only a short delay depending on cloud cover at the launch site. The sensor measurements are represented in by a block which produces ONIR sensor signals at an ONIR output port andor radar measurements at a RADAR output port . The sensor signals from whatever source are applied from ports and to a block which represents a multihypothesis track filter. The multihypothesis track filter combines a priori knowledge of the characteristics of various possible types of threat missiles with the track data from the sensors to establish separate estimates of the target hypotheses states at least position and velocity for n possible hypotheses. A multihypothesis track filter maintains separate filters for each hypothesis and uses a priori information about each hypothesis to improve the state estimates for each hypothesis over by comparison with a filter that uses no a priori information. One implementation of a multihypothesis filter is U.S. Pat. No. 7 026 980 to Boka et al. entitled Missile Identification and Tracking System and Method. The separate estimates consisting of n possible threat stage hypotheses appear at output ports . . . n of the track filter and are made available to a typing processor represented as a block and to a target propagator represented as a block . Typing algorithm or block uses multiple metrics to determine the likelihood that each hypothesis is correct. These likelihoods sum to unity or one and this summing characteristic is later used to generate weighting factors for each threat hypothesis.

The track filter states from track filter block of and the likelihoods from typing block are applied to a multihypothesis target propagator block . Target propagator block propagates into the future all those threat hypotheses having likelihoods above a threshold level. In one version of the target propagator the threshold level is fixed. As illustrated in target propagator block produces n m propagated threat states where m is the number of hypotheses with likelihoods falling below the threshold. Significant computational resource savings arise from not propagating the low likelihood threat states. Early in an engagement little track data is available from which the track filter can produce estimated track states so there is little information on which to base the discarding of hypotheses so most or all hypotheses are propagated. As more data becomes available from the sensors the typing block is expected to be able to discount certain hypotheses and to assign low probabilities to other hypotheses.

The propagated multihypothesis threat states from target propagator block of are applied to an engagement planner illustrated as a block together with the likelihood information from typing block . Engagement planner also receives interceptor missile flyout data or tables from a block illustrated as . Engagement planner uses a subset of the hypotheses to determine an optimal way to engage the target. In order to conserve computational resources the engagement planner ignores those hypotheses having likelihoods below the threshold. The optimal engagement information is coupled from block to initialize an interceptor guidance processing illustrated as a block .

Interceptor guidance block of receives optimal engagement information from block propagated threat missile states from target propagator block likelihood information from block and interceptor state information from a block . The interceptor state information contains information describing the state of the interceptor such as position velocity and acceleration at the time that the interceptor guidance function block is entered from block . Interceptor guidance block estimates the location of the target at the time of intercept in order to compute interceptor guidance commands. Launch and intercept guidance commands are applied from interceptor guidance block to the interceptor . During the course of an engagement the target state and hypothesis likelihoods are updated as more information becomes available. The track filter the target propagator the engagement planner and the interceptor guidance all take advantage of the new data to refine their solutions.

Interceptor guidance block of receives interceptor initialization information from engagement planner block propagated threat missile states for n m hypotheses from target propagator and typing information for the n m hypotheses from typing block . illustrates the logic or control flow of guidance stages for the four stage SM 3 interceptor missile. The processing for this control takes place partially in the interceptor guidance block of and partially in the interceptor missile itself. It will be understood that interceptor guidance block may be at a single location or it may be distributed among a plurality of locations or assets. In the control begins with a START block and flows to a block . Block represents initialization and launch of the interceptor missile. Block represents first stage guidance which may include simply a launch in the general direction of the target missile. The first stage guidance is controlled in accordance with prior art techniques and further generally includes the interceptor missile initially launching straight up then tilting a prescribed angle away from the ship toward the predicted intercept point PIP . At the end of the first stage guidance the control of logic of flows from first stage guidance block by way of a transition or path to a block which represents the second stage guidance. Details of the second stage guidance are illustrated by the logic of and incorporates aspects of the invention. When the second stage of propulsion and guidance represented by block is complete the logic of flows by way of a logic path to blocks and . Blocks and represent third and fourth stage guidance respectively of the SM 3 as known in the art. The third stage is guided to the updated predicted intercept point using inertial guidance performed by the interceptor missile. Terminal guidance of the SM 3 interceptor missile is performed by the fourth stage kinetic warhead using a modified version of proportional navigation to effect a hit to kill intercept of the target missile. The logic ends following block when the interceptor missile either hits the target or misses as suggested by block .

The method comprises the steps of tracking the position of the target missile with a sensor to determine its location generating a pre interceptor missile launch predicted intercept point and predicted intercept time and loading the predicted intercept point PIP and time into the interceptor missile guidance system. The interceptor missile is launched and the first stage guidance of is controlled at least in response to the target missile bearing and elevation towards the predicted intercept point. A transition is made along path to the second stage of propulsion of the interceptor missile as represented by block . Second stage midcourse guidance of the interceptor missile is controlled in response to second stage midcourse guidance acceleration commands generated by the processing of block of which as mentioned may be at any location including on the firing Aegis ship. Second stage midcourse guidance acceleration commands are generated in response to an elevated predicted intercept point. The elevated predicted intercept point is generated by adjusting a predicted intercept point PIP to account for the effects of interceptor missile velocity at waypoint interceptor missile propulsion beyond second stage and gravity between the waypoint and the PIP. The PIP is generated using the Runge Kutta integration method working on predicted target missile position velocity and acceleration. A transition is made by path of to third stage propulsion of the intercept missile block and the interceptor missile of is guided toward an updated predicted intercept point of the target missile. A transition is made to control of the fourth stage kinetic warhead to effect a hit to kill intercept of the target missile.

When the intercept triangle has been updated in block as described in conjunction with the logic of flows from block to a further block . Block represents determination of the average missile velocity remaining VMAR to Intercept. VMAR to Intercept block of calculates an updated average remaining missile velocity VMAR along the path extending from the missile s waypoint position to the updated elevated PIP in the time interval between the waypoint and the updated elevated PIP. VMAR is calculated using the equation

From block of the logic flows to a Second Stage Acceleration Commands block . Second Stage Acceleration Commands block calculates the second stage midcourse guidance acceleration commands that will guide the interceptor missile to achieve the desired direction of the interceptor missile s velocity vector at the waypoint as calculated in block of . The acceleration commands are calculated using an appropriate guidance law and will cause the interceptor missile to fly through the prescribed waypoint position with its relative velocity vector pointing in the prescribed direction as determined by the generalized midcourse guidance GMCG system. The generation of interceptor missile guidance acceleration commands up to Waypoint and determining average remaining velocity is well known to those skilled in the art and requires no further elaboration. The missile guidance acceleration commands are uplinked to the interceptor missile as suggested by path of .

From block the logic of flows back to Elevated PIP block through Next Update block iteratively repeating the steps of generating the elevated PIP in block generating and updating an intercept triangle in block determining the average remaining missile velocity VMAR until intercept in block and calculating 2stage acceleration commands in block to send to the interceptor missile. Each successive iteration through the GMCG loop in may use the updated variables from the previous iteration. The iterations continue until completion of second stage midcourse guidance where completion is defined as the reaching of the waypoint by the interceptor missile with the desired flight path angle calculated by the GMCG system in the Intercept Triangle block of . The waypoint is illustrated in and by the points and respectively.
