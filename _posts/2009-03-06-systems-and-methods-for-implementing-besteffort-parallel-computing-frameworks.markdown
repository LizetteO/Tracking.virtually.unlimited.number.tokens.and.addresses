title: Systems and methods for implementing best-effort parallel computing frameworks
abstract: Implementations of the present principles include Best-effort computing systems and methods. In accordance with various exemplary aspects of the present principles, a application computation requests directed to a processing platform may be intercepted and classified as either guaranteed computations or best-effort computations. Best-effort computations may be dropped to improve processing performance while minimally affecting the end result of application computations. In addition, interdependencies between best-effort computations may be relaxed to improve parallelism and processing speed while maintaining accuracy of computation results.
