title: Cache enumeration and indexing
abstract: In response to a request including a state object, which can indicate a state of an enumeration of a cache, the enumeration can be continued by using the state object to identify and send cache data. Also, an enumeration of cache units can be performed by traversing a data structure that includes object nodes, which correspond to cache units, and internal nodes. An enumeration state stack can indicate a current state of the enumeration, and can include state nodes that correspond to internal nodes in the data structure. Additionally, a cache index data structure can include a higher level table and a lower level table. The higher level table can have a leaf node pointing to the lower level table, and the lower level table can have a leaf node pointing to one of the cache units. Moreover, the lower level table can be associated with a tag.
