title: Spectral resolution enhancement of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging
abstract: A method and apparatus for enhancing the spectral resolution of magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) measurements include receiving time domain echo data from an MRS measurement for an MRS volume in a subject. Also received are high spatial resolution complex signal values within the MRS volume based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements. Frequency-domain content is determined for the echo data based at least in part on the complex signal values. For example, in some embodiments, receiving complex signal values includes receiving high spatial resolution complex signal values within the MRS volume for each of two different echo time settings. The frequency-domain content of the echo data is corrected for a lineshape profile based on high resolution frequency dispersion values for the MRS volume determined from differences in the complex signal values for the two different echo time settings.

This application claims benefit of Provisional Appln. 61 056 103 filed May 27 2008 under 35 U.S.C. 119 e .

This invention was made with partial government support for Zhengchao Dong by the New York State Psychiatric Institute NYSPI . The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS and in particular to enhancing spectral resolution of MRS and MRS imaging MRSI by de convolving the effects of spatial variations in the base magnetic field B determined from magnetic resonance imaging MRI . In the following the base magnetic field or static magnetic field may represent the combination of the external magnetic field and the macroscopic effects of the tissue susceptibility.

Nuclear magnetic resonance NMR studies magnetic nuclei by aligning them with an applied constant magnetic field B and perturbing this alignment using an alternating magnetic field B orthogonal to the constant magnetic field. The resulting response to the perturbing magnetic field is the phenomenon that is exploited in magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS and magnetic resonance imaging MRI .

The elementary particles neutrons and protons composing an atomic nucleus have the intrinsic quantum mechanical property of spin. The overall spin of the nucleus is determined by the spin quantum number I. If the number of both the protons and neutrons in a given isotope are even then I 0. In other cases however the overall spin is non zero. A non zero spin is associated with a non zero magnetic moment as given by Equation 1a. 1a where the proportionality constant is the gyromagnetic ratio. It is this magnetic moment that is exploited in NMR. For example nuclei that have a spin of one half like Hydrogen nuclei H a single proton have two possible spin states also referred to as up and down respectively . The energies of these states are the same. Hence the populations of the two states i.e. number of atoms in the two states will be approximately equal at thermal equilibrium. If a nucleus is placed in a magnetic field however the interaction between the nuclear magnetic moment and the external magnetic field means the two states no longer have the same energy. The energy difference between the two states is given by Equation 1b. 1b where is Plank s reduced constant. Resonant absorption will occur when electromagnetic radiation of the correct frequency to match this energy difference is applied. The energy of photons of electromagnetic radiation is given by Equation 2. 2 where f is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation and h 2 . Thus absorption will occur when the frequency is given by Equation 3. 2 3 

The NMR frequency f is shifted by the shielding effect of the surrounding electrons. In general this electronic shielding reduces the magnetic field at the nucleus which is what determines the NMR frequency . As a result the energy gap is reduced and the frequency required to achieve resonance is also reduced. This shift of the NMR frequency due to the chemical environment is called the chemical shift and it explains why NMR is a direct probe of chemical structure.

Applying a short electromagnetic pulse in the radio frequency range to a set of nuclear spins simultaneously excites all the NMR transitions. In terms of the net magnetization vector this corresponds to tilting the magnetization vector away from its equilibrium position aligned along the external magnetic field B . The out of equilibrium magnetization vector precesses about the external magnetic field at the NMR frequency of the spins. This oscillating magnetization induces a current in a nearby pickup coil acting as a radio frequency RF receiver creating an electrical signal oscillating at the NMR frequency. A portion of this time domain signal intensity vs. time is known as the free induction decay FID and contains the sum of the NMR responses from all the excited spins. In order to obtain the frequency domain NMR spectrum intensity vs. frequency for magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS and MRS imaging MRSI this time domain signal is Fourier transformed.

Spectral resolution refers to the ability to distinguish two closely spaced peaks in any spectrum. It is one of the important criteria that define the quality of MRS and MRSI. Low spectral resolution can obscure the information available from molecules of interest such as metabolites in a volume of tissue thus making difficult or impossible the detection and quantification of some or all of those metabolites.

Reduced spectral resolution is a special problem for in vivo proton MRS H MRS of the brain for several reasons. First the chemical shift differences of different brain metabolites are relatively small i.e the spectral peaks are inherently very close to each other and the line splitting caused by J coupling further reduces the separation of the peaks in the spectrum. J coupling also called indirect dipole dipole coupling is the coupling between two nuclear spins due to the influence of bonding electrons on the magnetic field running between the two nuclei. Consequently spectral lines of some molecules intrinsically overlap and might not be distinguished. Second magnetic field inhomogeneity caused by the spatial variation of the static external field Band by local susceptibility differences of different tissues may produce linebroadening and distortion of lineshape and thereby reduce spectral resolution. As a result some lines that are intrinsically separated may overlap in standard MSR measurements and can not be resolved within the portion of the spectrum associated with the metabolites. Third motion of the person being imaged may produce linebroadening and reduce spectral resolution.

Many techniques have been developed to improve the spectral resolution of in vivo MRS. These techniques can be classified into two categories representing either acquisition or processing of the spectral data.

Within the category of data acquisition the most commonly employed strategy for improving spectral resolution is the automated techniques for improving the homogeneity of the magnetic field B. Fast and high order shimming techniques have been implemented on modern scanners to make Bmore uniform across a subject being scanned yet these methods cannot eliminate all variation in local magnetic fields that are caused by the differing magnetic susceptibilities of various interposed tissues within the body. To image at higher magnetic field strengths is another strategy to increase spectral resolution as well as the signal to noise ratio SNR of the MRS. Theoretically doubling the field strength should double the differences in chemical shifts and the separations peaks in the metabolic spectrum. Unfortunately the observed benefit of higher field strengths in improving spectral resolution is much lower than theoretically predicted. For example spectral resolution at 3 Tesla T 1 T 1 Newton per Ampere per meter only increases marginally compared with spectral resolution obtained at 1.5 T. Two reasons for this are that scanners with higher field strengths come with greater inhomogeneity of their magnetic fields and the higher fields shorten the Trelaxation times of metabolites both of which increase linewidths of the spectrum. The Trelaxation time is the time for precessing nuclei to fall out of alignment with each other returning the net magnetization vector to a non precessing field and thus stop producing a signal. In addition the upper limit on field strength is constrained by practical and safety considerations. Techniques of fast acquisition of data can reduce the total scan time and thereby reduce the likelihood that the person being imaged moves and this will indirectly reduce the linebroadening caused by subject motion. Other acquisition based techniques that are designed to improve spectral resolution include higher spatial resolution MRSI and 2 dimensional 2D J resolved MRSI. However both of these techniques usually require long scan times which cannot be afforded in many clinical and research applications.

Most processing methods to improve spectral resolution are either borrowed or modified from those commonly used in processing conventional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR but these usually produce very limited improvements of spectral resolution for data acquired in vivo. The method of Positive Exponential Multiplication PEM for example multiplies the free induction decay FID defined above with a positive exponential function. Although this operation can increase the spectral resolution it also increases noise in the signal and reduces its overall SNR. This is a price that usually cannot be afforded with the in vivo data because the SNR of in vivo MRS is typically already very low. A method similar to PEM is the double exponential multiplication DEM which transforms the Lorentzian lineshape to a Gaussian lineshape which has a narrower linewidth at the bottom of a peak than the former does. With carefully selected exponential factors DEM can improve spectral resolution while largely preserving the SNR. Because the lineshape of in vivo MRS is more Gaussian than Lorentzian however DEM has limited applicability for in vivo MRSI. Another processing based method is the spectral de convolution using the isolated singlet of water as a reference. An assumption of this approach is that the water peak and metabolic peaks have an identical lineshape which is not always true for in vivo MRSI due at least to two reasons 1 the differences in distribution profiles and 2 the chemical shift artifacts. Moreover acquiring an MRSI for water doubles the total MRSI scan time about 30 minutes per scan which cannot be afforded in many clinical and research applications. Because of these inherent difficulties the existing processing based methods have limited applicability for improving spectral resolution in MRSI in vivo.

Techniques are provided for enhancing the spectral resolution of magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS .

In one set of embodiments a method includes receiving time domain echo data from an MRS measurement for an MRS volume in a subject. Also received are high spatial resolution complex signal values within the MRS volume based on magnetic resonance imaging MRI measurements. Frequency domain content is determined for the echo data based at least in part on the complex signal values.

In another set of embodiments a method includes collecting time domain echo data such as FID data for an MRS volume in a subject using an MRS system. Also collected are high spatial resolution complex signal values in the MRS volume using a magnetic resonance imaging MRI mode of the MRS system. Frequency domain content of the echo data is determined based at least in part on the complex signal values.

In other embodiments an apparatus or a computer readable medium is configured to perform one or more steps of the above methods.

A method and apparatus are described for enhancing the spectral resolution of magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS and consequently magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging MRSI . In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.

Some embodiments of the invention are descried below in the context of detecting brain metabolites in magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging MRSI . However the invention is not limited to this context. In other embodiments one or more other constituents in a magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS volume are determined for imaging or non imaging operations on human or non human or inanimate subjects in vivo or not.

The inventors have discovered that desirable improvement in resolution of MR spectra can be obtained more efficiently than extant approaches. These techniques significantly enhance the spectral resolution of MRS and MRSI by correcting local field in homogeneities caused both by the main field Band susceptibility differences of the tissues. A second time consuming water MRSI scan is not required. Certain embodiments are validated and demonstrated by phantom and in vivo experiments. The results show that these techniques can not only enhance the spectral resolution and improve the lineshape but also increase the SNR of both MRS and MRSI.

At a given magnetic field strength spectral resolution is related to linewidth of the spectrum which is in turn determined jointly by the natural linewidth and linebroadening that is caused by inhomogeneity of the magnetic field. Microscopically the linewidth of a metabolite spectrum from a particular MRS volume of a subject can be regarded as a combination of many spectral lines originating from tiny sub volumes of the particular volume each of these having their natural linewidths but with their differing frequencies altered slightly by the small strength differences of local field where the sub volumes are located. Mathematically this combination is described as a procedure of convolution of the natural linewidth and the profile of the lineshape. For in vivo MRSI the profile of lineshape or the lineshape function is determined largely by the linebroadening caused by the field inhomogeneity in the static magnetic field B.

The inventors have determined that the profile of the lineshape can be derived from the summation of the spectral lines with infinite linewidths. After de convolving the measured spectra from the lineshape function that is derived from the measured field mapping the inventors discovered that the linewidth is reduced significantly and thereby the spectral resolution of the in vivo MRS is enhanced. The inventors have designated some embodiments of this method as Spectral Resolution Amelioration by De convolution SPREAD . The field mapping can be generated with one or two MRI scans about three minutes each or less.

The following theoretical description is provided for purposes of more thoroughly explaining the disclosed embodiments. However the invention is not limited by the completeness or accuracy of the following theoretical description.

A particular MRS volume is excited and all or part of the echo measured from that particular volume by using phase encoding PE magnetic gradient pulses with gradient magnitude G t and duration that impose spatial information on the MR signals of nuclei in the subject as is well known in the art. The properties of the gradient pulses are expressed by a wavenumber k in the spatial frequency wavenumber domain. A vector wavenumber right arrow over k is defined by Equation 4a.

As described in more detail below f can be derived from MRI measurements and such derivation has been used to create images at MRI spatial resolution called field maps that indicate spatial variations in B by virtue of Equation 5. MRI spatial resolution provides imaging volume elements voxels that are much smaller than a typical MRS voxel. For example an MRSI voxel is approximately three orders of magnitude larger than a high resolution MRI voxel e.g. an MRSI voxel is on the order of cubic centimeters cm and a MRI voxel is on the order of cubic millimeters mm where 1 mm 10meters and 1 cm 10meters .

In the case of conventional two spatial dimensions 2D MRSI as is well known there are Nx phase encoding steps in the x direction and Ny phase encoding steps in the y direction where x and y directions are perpendicular to each other and to the direction z. The static magnetic field Bis often in the z direction but need not be. In this case Equation 6a expresses the relationship between the wavenumber vectors. 1 2 6a This results in Nx Ny phase encoded signals which are represented by a three dimensional 3D matrix in wavenumber space with two spatial dimensions and one time domain spectral dimension as given by Equation 6b.

It is further assumed for purposes of explanation that right arrow over r f is constant across the MRS voxel V. Equation 7 then can be written as expressed in Equation 8.

The ideal signal s t can be recovered from the measured signal s t by dividing the lineshape profile in a point by point manner as given in Equation 9.

As mentioned above and described in more detail below f is derived from MRI measurements on much smaller MRI voxels. Because the typical MRS voxel is approximately 3 orders of magnitude larger than a high resolution MRI voxel in some embodiments the integration in the denominator in Equation 9 is approximated by the summation of the integrand over all high resolution MRI voxels in the lower resolution MRS voxel. This approximation is expressed in Equation 10.

In other embodiments described in more detail below the lineshape profile based on the MRI measurements is modified to better match the processing performed on the MRSI data and to account for PSF effects. Furthermore in some embodiments the lineshape profile is further modified to prevent spikes in the de convolved spectrum where the lineshape profile crosses zero. In some embodiments the lineshape profile is further modified to prevent noise amplification where the signal amplitude falls to values comparable to the noise level.

Equation 9 was derived under the assumption that the spin density right arrow over r f is constant within a voxel V which is clearly not always true especially in voxels consisting of multiple tissue types. In such circumstances the lineshape is a function of both the field inhomogeneity and the concentrations of metabolites. However field inhomogeneity is dominant and the effect of the spatial varying concentration within the voxel is small. Moreover the two effects are independent and the final lineshape after de convolution would be concentration weighted compared to the ideal lineshape. This approximation is often acceptable. In other embodiments spin density variations within a voxel are estimated or assumed and accounted for in the lineshape profile determined and applied.

In step MRS time domain echo data is collected from one or more MRS volumes in a subject. For example free induction decay FID data is collected during step . Step includes operating an MRS apparatus or system to deliver one or more phase encoded pulses and measure the phase encoded currents in a receiving antenna coil. This includes performing any shimming to make the static magnetic field Bas spatially uniform as possible. Step also includes receiving the echo data at a data processing device such as a general purpose computer. Any method may be used to perform step .

For example in an illustrated embodiment during step MRS data was acquired using a whole body 3 T scanner Signa 3.0 T GE Healthcare Waukesha Wis. equipped with a single channel volume coil for transmission and a standard quadrature head coil for receiving radiofrequency RF signals. Scout images in 3 orthogonal planes were first acquired for the localization of MRSI images. MRSI data were acquired using a multi planar MRSI pulse sequence as described in Duyn J H Gillen J Sobering G van Zijl P C Moonen C T Multisection proton MR spectroscopic imaging of the brain 1993 188 1 pp 277 282. Image slices were placed in the axial plane and were angulated so as to parallel the anterior commissure posterior commissure AC PC line. The parameters used for data acquisition were as follows. Field of View FOV was set to 24 24 cm. Number of slices was set to 4. Nominal number of phase encoding PE steps in the x and y directions was set to 16 16 data were sampled in an inscribed circle of diameter 16 in wavenumber space resulting in an actual number of 180 PEs . Slice thickness was set to 10 mm with spacing between slices set to 2 mm. The nominal MRS voxel size was therefore 2.25 cm. Repetition time TR was set to 2800 ms after an echo time TE of 144 ms. Spectral width of the RF receiver was 2000 Hz. An asymmetric echo with a long tail was acquired with 512 complex data points. Outer volume lipid signal was suppressed with user placed saturation bands. Water suppression was realized by the CHESS pulses imbedded in the phase encoded sequence as described in Haase A Frahm J Hanicke W Matthaei D. H NMR chemical shift selective CHESS imaging 1985 30 4 pp 341 344.

In step MRI complex signal data is collected from multiple high resolution MRI voxels within each MRS volume at two different echo times. Step includes operating an MRS apparatus or system to deliver one or more phase encoded pulses and measure the phase encoded currents in a receiving antenna coil at the two echo times. This includes performing any shimming performed during step to make the static magnetic field Bas spatially uniform as possible. Step also includes receiving the complex signal data at a data processing device such as a general purpose computer. Any method may be used to perform step . For example in some embodiments an MRI scan can be run with TE1 and then another MRI scan with TE2 at three to four minutes each. In some embodiments a single MRI scan can be run with embedded TE1 acquisition and different TE2 acquisition.

In an illustrated embodiment during step immediately following step high resolution MR images for field mapping were acquired using a commercial 3D MRI pulse sequence called Incoherent RF Spoiled Gradient Echo SPGR . The slices of the 3D SPGR were parallel to the slices of the MRSI and the imaged volume of the 3D SPGR is slightly larger than that of the MRSI. The echo times of the two MR images were 8 and 10.5 ms respectively. Other imaging parameters for the field mapping MRI sequence were as follows. The FOV was set to 24 24 cm. The slice thickness was set to 2 mm. The in plane resolution was 256 256 resulting in a nominal spatial resolution of 1.7 mm. TR was set to 13 ms. The flip angle was set to 11. The RF receiver bandwidth SW was 15.6 kHz. As a result each MRSI slice covers 5 MRI slices and each MRS volume overlaps 1280 MRI voxels. To ensure identical field inhomogeneity during both the MRSI scan and MRI scan only first order shimming was performed for MRSI and the same shim values were kept for the MRI scans. All wavenumber space data for MRI were saved in complex form to facilitate generating the field maps. In addition all MRI data were saved in the conventional magnitude form in the well known DICOM format.

Step follows step in a preferred embodiment because the shimming PE encoding and other operational settings of the MRS measurement are already in place for the corresponding MRI measurements. In some embodiments the shimming scan is done first then the MRI scans are done without further shimming then the MRSI scan is done without further shimming. In this way both MRI and MRSI scans have the same shimming and thus the same magnetic field inhomogeneity.

During step frequency dispersion is computed for each MRS volume based on differences in MRI complex signal data for the two echo times as described in more detail in the next section.

In step the frequency dispersion is de convolved from the MRS echo data to obtain corrected echo data. Step includes determining a lineshape profile based on the frequency dispersion. In some embodiments step includes determining and applying modifications to match the wavenumber space processing in the MRS data processing or suppressing spikes at zero crossing of the lineshape profile or suppressing noise amplification or performing other corrections or some combination as described in more detail in a later section.

In step the frequency domain content e.g. the MRS spectrum is computed for the corrected echo data. The resulting spectrum has enhanced spectral resolution.

These embodiments have several advantages over the long standing spectral de convolution technique using internal water as a reference as described in Macri M A Garreffa G Giove F Guardati M Ambrosini A Colonnese C Maraviglia B In vivo quantitative 1H MRS of cerebellum and evaluation of quantitation reproducibility by simulation of different levels of noise and spectral resolution 2004 22 10 pp 1385 139. The lineshape of unsuppressed water signal depends not only on spatial variation of the magnetic field Bbut also on the distribution of water content of the brain. When more than one tissue types with differing water contents such as gray matter and white matter in a human brain especially cerebrospinal fluid co exist in significant quantities in an MRS voxel the lineshape of water signal will deviate from the lineshape caused purely by field inhomogeneity. On the other hand the illustrated embodiments eliminate lineshape distortion caused solely by field inhomogeneity. The Trelaxation time of tissue water is shorter than those of most metabolites and therefore the water signal decays more rapidly than metabolite signals in the time domain. Consequently noise amplification and spike artifacts often occur at both ends of the resultant de convolved signal when water signal becomes smaller than the metabolite signals. Therefore the gain in resolution improvement is often at the price of deteriorated SNR. On the other hand Trelaxation time of the reconstructed lineshape signal is virtually infinite and the lineshape signal decays slower than any metabolite signals. Therefore the noise amplification and spike artifacts can largely be avoided. Internal water signal requires measuring the water MRSI in addition to the metabolite MRSI which means double the total MRSI scan time. This is often unaffordable in many situations. Although the illustrated embodiments include MRI measurements for and computations of magnetic field maps the time for measuring and determining these maps is about three minutes or less only a small portion of the time for MRSI scan.

The illustrated embodiments such as SPREAD improve the spectral resolution by narrowing the linewidth and correcting lineshape distortion. These embodiments effectively increase the separations between spectral peaks without increasing their absolute frequency differences which is different from the strategies of imaging at higher magnetic field. Preliminary results showed that the SPREAD embodiment increased the spectral resolution by up to 50 and more in a phantom and up to 25 and more in human scans which is higher than the increase of spectral resolution from 1.5 T to 3 T see for example Dydak U Schar M MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging comparing 3.0 T versus 1.5 T 2006 16 2 pp 269 283 . A current comparison study on the SNR of proton MRS between 3 T and 7 T shows that the SNR only improved marginally at 7 T against 3 T Y Li et al. 16 2008 p 1592 . This is likely because the increased linewidth at higher magnetic field strength can almost completely offset the increase in the chemical shifts. Another advantage of the SPREAD embodiment over the higher magnetic field strength strategy is that the SPREAD embodiment improves the lineshape of the spectrum and therefore allows improving the accuracy of the spectral fitting. Furthermore the SPREAD embodiment avoids the adverse effects of higher magnetic field strengths such as decreased SNR increase chemical shift artifact as well as increased RF field B inhomogeneity.

The performance of the illustrated embodiments for spectral resolution enhancement depends on the accurate field mapping and thereby the accurate reconstruction of the experimental lineshape. In general the higher the resolution is the more accurate the field mapping is. However higher resolution may require longer measurement time or result in lower SNR. The latter is detrimental for the accuracy of field mapping. In our pilot study we found that the experimental lineshape reconstructed from ten 2D field maps of 1 mm thick was not superior to that reconstructed from 5 field maps of 2 mm thick under the condition that the measurement time and the in plane resolution of each slice was the same. This is likely because the benefit of higher spatial resolution was balanced by the disadvantage of lower SNR. 3D MRI sequence is preferable for high resolution field mapping in some embodiments as it can generate MR images with much higher SNR than the 2D mode can.

During step the frequency dispersion is determined in the course of performing magnetic field mapping as taught by Willcott M R 3rd Mee G L Chesick J P. Magnetic field mapping in NMR imaging 1987 5 4 pp 301 306.

For purpose of illustrating how frequency dispersion is derived from MRI measurements at two different echo times consider the following description. is a graph that illustrates an example applied magnetic field B for a one dimensional high spatial resolution MRI measurement. The horizontal axis is distance in the x direction e.g. in mm perpendicular to the direction of the constant magnetic field B. The vertical axis is magnetic flux density e.g. in Tesla T . The constant magnetic field in the z direction B is plotted as curve and shows small variations as x varies. A change in the z direction magnetic field with changes in x position is called the gradient magnetic field G and is applied to distinguish different volumes within a subject for spatial encoding. The resulting magnetic field B from the gradient G is also plotted in the graph . The subject occupies x positions between position and position on the x axis . A point x is depicted within the subject and represents a high resolution MRI voxel location with a width comparable to the width of the tick mark. MRSI uses electromagnetic wave returns from voxels that each represents a wider range of x values so one dimensional low resolution voxels are depicted along the x axis including voxel and voxel collectively referenced hereinafter as MRSI voxels .

Along the x direction the magnetic field is given by Equation 11. 11 The frequency fof a proton with gyromagnetic ratio at point xis given by Equation 12. 12 In the presence of G nuclei at different positions x have different resonant frequencies and their signals the so called wavenumber signal can thus be spatially encoded. After data acquisition a spatial Fourier Transform FT is used to decode the signal and recover the position of the signal within the subject.

At an initial time t0 the protons in the field B are perturbed with a magnetic field in the y direction perpendicular to x and z and those perturbed protons precess about the z direction with a frequency equal to the magnetic resonance frequency f. If data is collected after a delay of TE1 then the protons have precessed by an angle associated with a phase 1 that is related to the precession frequency. For example at point x 1 in units of radians is given by Equation 13a. 1 21 2 1 13a The measured MRI signal at position xis given by Equation 13b. 1 1 0 exp 1 0 exp 21 13b where exp is a function that raises the natural constant e to the power of the value inside the parentheses j is the square root of 1 and s x t is a complex number. The raw data from an MRI measurement with echo time TE1 is a vector of complex number with phases of 1 that vary with x. The phase is determined from these measurements of s1 x t by a function of the real and imaginary parts as measured by quadrature receiver coils in the MRS apparatus e.g. arctan imaginary part real part . By analogy in a two dimensional case the raw data is a matrix of complex numbers with phases 1 that vary with x and y.

If data is collected after a delay of TE2 then the protons have precessed by an angle associated with a phase 2 that is related to the precession frequency. For example at point x 2 in units of radians is given by Equation 13c. 2 22 2 2 13c The measured MRI signal at position xis given by Equation 13d. 2 2 0 exp 2 0 exp 22 13d The raw data from an MRI measurement with echo time TE2 is a vector of complex number with phases of 2 that vary with x. By analogy in a two dimensional case the raw data is a matrix of complex numbers with phases 2 that vary with x and y.

The only difference between s1 x t from Equation 13b and s2 x t from Equation 13d is the phase angles. The phase angle difference is given by Equation 14. 2 1 14 The distribution of precession frequency fis derived from the spatial distribution of using Equation 15a and Equation 15b. 2 15a where 2 1 15b Differencing on a voxel by voxel basis gives a vector of f values for 1D MRI data and a matrix of f values for 2D MRI data.

If there is frequency dispersion such as caused by variations in the static magnetic field B then the difference in the two measured values s1 x t and s2 x t at different positions x corrected for different values of the gradient G will not reflect the same value of f. The spread of frequency among close positions is denoted the dispersion f. A lineshape profile for an MRS volume is based on the dispersion of f at all MRI voxels within an MRS volume as described in more detail in a later section. For purposes of illustration an example lineshape profile associated with the value fis depicted in e.g. for one high resolution MRI voxel at location xwithin MRSI voxel . is a graph that illustrates an example lineshape profile for the one dimensional high spatial resolution MRI measurement of according to an embodiment. In the time domain the lineshape profile is an oscillating function with a period related to f. The Fourier transform to the frequency domain shows a peak at fwith width related to the intrinsic linewidth so the lineshape profiles are shown in the frequency domain. The horizontal axis is frequency and the vertical axis is intensity. A lineshape profile is plotted which shows a peak at f. The peak shape is Lorentzian and the width is very small for lineshape profile . is a graph that illustrates an example lineshape profile for the one dimensional low spatial resolution MRSI measurement according to an embodiment. The frequency axis and intensity axis are as described above for . The lineshape profile is plotted for MRSI voxel based on Equation 10. With an inhomogeneous Bacross the MRSI voxel the peak shape is distorted and non Lorentzian and the width broadened by B related to frequency dispersion f is many times wider for lineshape profile compared to lineshape profile .

In an illustrated embodiment MR images in the complex format were reconstructed from wavenumber space data by applying spatial Fast Fourier Transform FFT processing well known in the art following a 2D spatial filtering with a Hamming window function also well known. The phase unwrapping procedure was performed using a program provided by Dr. Peled see N. Saad S. Peled Easy 3D Phase Unwrapping 13 2005 p2251 . However complex conjugate multiplication of the paired MR images with different TEs were used as the input instead of the individual MR images for computational efficiency and robustness as described in Meyer C Irarrazabal P. Magnetic field inhomogeneity correction in MRI using estimated linear magnetic field map U.S. Pat. No. 5 617 028 1997. These unwrapped phase images were converted into field maps as represented by the frequency deviations across the slices.

In step the effects of the frequency dispersion determined during step is de convolved from the MRS echo data. Any method may be used to do this. In the illustrated embodiment a lineshape profile is first determined that is matched to each MRS volume voxel in the MRSI.

In the illustrated embodiment the lineshape profile for each voxel in the matrix of a 2D MRSI slice was determined from these field maps as follows to match the processing of each MRS volume. Synthetic echo signals with the form of were synthesized for MRI voxels in an MRI slice. The values f were obtained from the field mapping and t started from a negative value synchronized with the start of data acquisition of the pulse sequence so as to form echoes at the time point t 0. This gives a 3D dataset with two spatial dimensions of the same resolution as the MRI and one spectral dimension of the same spectral resolution as the actual MRSI data. The above procedure is repeated for all MRI slices and the datasets corresponding to each MRSI slice are added together. A series of 2D spatial inverse Fourier Transforms were performed to transform the spatial signals for all MRSI slices back into wavenumber space. The resulting lineshape profile is L t given by Equation 16a. 16a where j is the square root of 1. Note that the phase encoding dimension in the wavenumber space is the same as the spatial dimensions of the MRI slice e.g. 256 256 . The wavenumber space data in the two phase encoding dimensions is cropped into the size of the phase encoded wavenumber space in the MRSI e.g. 24 24 . In the illustrated embodiment the non zero wavenumber space data were in an inscribed circle in the square of the nominal phase encoded wavenumber space. The cropped wavenumber space data is filtered with the Hamming window function as done for the measured MRSI data. The data then undergo another Fourier Transform back into spatial domain with a half voxel shifting in both x and y directions.

In some embodiments the lineshape profile can be obtained by directly simulating the phase encoding procedure of the real world MRSI data acquisition. In this realization the synthesized echo e.g. the synthesized FID signals are modified by multiplying them with phase encoding functions in the form of exp j2 right arrow over k right arrow over r and by integrating the product over the whole MRSI volume V. The resultant lineshape signal for the voxel V is L t k given by Equation 16.

In some embodiments step includes de convolving the lineshape profile for an MRS voxel from the echo data to produce corrected echo data. In the illustrated embodiment spectral de convolution was based on Equation 9. Ideally this de convolution eliminates the linebroadening caused by the field inhomogeneity and spectra are obtained with natural linewidths.

A 3D lineshape signal 2 spatial dimensions and 1 spectral dimension for each MRSI slice and at the in plane resolution of the MRSI voxel was constructed from field maps within the MRSI slice using the method described above.

However at both ends of the echo the amplitude of the time domain lineshape profile in the denominator approaches zero. Two adverse consequences may result 1 when the profile decays to the noise level of the acquired signal and below noise amplification may occur and 2 when the amplitude of the profile approaches zero spikes may appear in the de convolved signal.

To suppress the noise at the ends of the echo and the spikes at zero reaching points a modified Wiener filtering window was applied to the signal. Therefore the de convolution was performed as expressed by Equation 17a. 17a where L t is the lineshape function taking the PSF effects into account computed as described above in Equation 16a or Equation 16b in some embodiments for each MRS voxel and w t is the time domain modified Gaussian Wiener window function as defined in Equation 17b.

Although the de convolution without Wiener filtering can ideally recover the spectra with natural linewidth its performance is vulnerable to noise and to the zero crossing points at the end of the time domain signal. Therefore the Wiener filtering was used in the spectral de convolution in an illustrated embodiment. The results show that with Wiener filtering the performance of the de convolution is more stable and robust. In case the first few points of the time domain signal were corrupted by the switching of the analog to digital converter ADC a cosine window function is applied in some embodiments. The cosine window acts mainly on the corrupted points to increase the robustness of the method. Because the signals at the ends of the echo are very small the cosine factor of the window function has little effect on the lineshape of the resultant spectrum after de convolution. In various other embodiments other filtering windows are applied including but not limited to Gaussian Cosine Gaussian Lorentzian Cosine Lorentzian modified Cosine or Half Cosine alone or in some combination.

In an illustrated embodiment the uncorrected echo data s t is also conditioned before performing the de convolution given by Equation 17a. The measured wavenumber space MRSI data were Fourier transformed into spatial domain following a Hamming window filtering and a half voxel shifting which is the same as a step in lineshape profile formation for the illustrated embodiment described above. The water residue in each voxel spectrum is removed using the SVD based Matrix Pencil Method because it can eliminate water components without phase distortion. The resultant signal for the MRS voxel V is still denoted by s t . The spatial time domain MRSI data after water removal were submitted to the de convolution procedure represented by Equation 17a. After de convolution the time domain data were zero padded to 2048 points and transformed to frequency domain to obtain the more ideal MR spectrum. In various other embodiments other conditioning is used such as applying a window function selecting from a group including among others a Hamming window a Hanning window and a Gaussian window alone or in any combination.

In the illustrated embodiments all programs used for implementing SPREAD were written in MATLAB The MathWorks Inc Natick Mass. . The most time consuming part of SPREAD is the reconstruction of the lineshapes from the field maps. For an MRSI slice consisting of 5 MRI field mapping slices with 256 256 in plane MRI resolution the reconstruction of the lineshapes of 16 16 MRSI voxels took about 32 seconds on a PC with a 4G Hz processor.

Synchronization of the time domain signals to align the peaks of the echoes is beneficial for the procedure of de convolution in some embodiments otherwise the resultant signal would suffer from phase and lineshape distortions as well as deteriorated spectral resolution. The position of the echo peak is calculated from the timing of the pulse sequence and if needed is adjusted by measuring the echo of the water signal acquired in a single voxel MRS using the same pulse sequence and timing but without phase encoding. In various other embodiments other synchronization methods are applied. Once the position is determined the value is used in forming the lineshape signals according to the field maps for all MRSI data acquired with the same timing parameters.

In some embodiments one or more steps of the method are incorporated into an MRS scanning system or apparatus. is a block diagram that illustrates an example MRS system according to an embodiment. The system includes a scanning apparatus and a computer controller . Although a subject for MRS scanning is depicted in subject is not part of the MRS system .

The scanning apparatus includes a Bmagnet an x gradient magnet a y gradient magnet a z gradient magnet a group of shim coils e.g. shim coils and a radio frequency RF transmitter an RF receiver a communications interface and a processor . As depicted the components of scanner are standard and well known in the art.

The computer controller sends signals to the communications interface in scanner that causes the scanner to operate the gradient magnets and and the RF transmitter and RF receiver to obtain NMR data.

In the illustrated embodiment computer controller includes process to enhance spectral resolution. Process performs one or more steps of method . For example process causes scanner to collect MRSI echo data at each of 24 24 MRSI voxels e.g. voxels depicted in and to collect complex MRI data at each of 256 256 MRI voxels for each of two echo times TE1 and TE2. The collected data is received at computer controller or another computer and used to determine MRSI spectra with enhanced spectral resolution using additional steps of method .

In some embodiments process is performed by processor within scanner . In various embodiments one or more steps of method are performed by multiple processors on scanner or computer controller or other computers connected to computer controller via a network.

In an example embodiment the subject was a spectroscopy phantom. The field homogeneity was deliberately destroyed in the y direction by changing shimming parameters. Severe field inhomogeneity was seen in the interface between liquid and air. Thus the linewidth of the MRS peak for protons in water was increased and the lineshape distorted. Because the water concentration was homogenous in the phantom the linewidth and lineshape could only be altered by spatial variation of the magnetic field. Using the MRI field mapping data lineshapes in the frequency domain were constructed as described above and compared to the measured peaks of H in water. is a scan that illustrates an example magnetic field map that depicts frequency dispersion in a phantom according to an embodiment. The scan is divided onto a grid that corresponds to MRSI voxels. The horizontal axis is MRSI voxel column number. The vertical axis is MRSI voxel row number. The grayscale bar indicates the f scale in Hertz. Because both large negative and large positive values are dark the dark negative areas and dark positive areas are indicated in the scan . MRSI voxel is indicated for which spectra are computed.

In the MRSI voxels adjacent to the liquid air interface such as MRSI voxel the lineshapes were severely distorted and the linewidth was broadened. is a graph that illustrates an example MRS measurement of the spectrum of water in an MRSI voxel of the phantom. The horizontal axis is frequency sample points. The vertical axis is intensity in arbitrary units. The measured lineshape profile is distorted and broad. is a graph that illustrates an example reconstructed lineshape profile for the MRS voxel based on integrating the lineshape profiles of the MRI voxels in the MRSI voxel according to an embodiment. The horizontal axis is frequency sample points as in . The vertical axis is intensity in arbitrary units. The reconstructed lineshape profile based on integrating the dispersion terms from the MRI voxels over the MRSI voxel is plotted. It is noted that these lineshapes can not be described by Lorentzain Gaussian and Voigt functions and constitute a challenge for the spectral fitting. The computed lineshapes in such MRSI voxels are identical to measured lineshapes of water. However the widths of the computed lineshapes are narrower than those of water because the measured water signal has an intrinsic linewidth that is not included in the computed linewidths.

A spectrum from a voxel in the region with strong magnetic field inhomogeneity in the phantom was observed in which the peaks of Creatine at 3.04 MHz and Choline at 3.24 MHz severely overlap and can not be resolved. is a graph that illustrates an example MR spectrum from the MRSI voxel after removing the water peak according to an embodiment. The horizontal axis is frequency sample points. The vertical axis is intensity in arbitrary units. Data were measured with water suppression. Residual water was further suppressed by SVD based method. However the water residue is still sizable because of its bad lineshape. The residual spectrum is plotted and includes a peak and peak . is a graph that illustrates an example MR spectrum corrected by the lineshape profile of after removing the water peak according to an embodiment. The horizontal and vertical axes are as described for . The residual spectrum is plotted and includes a peak peak and peak . After SPREAD treatment the peak is clearly separated into two peaks and for Choline and Creatine respectively which therefore could be easily resolved. Furthermore the distorted NAA peak is resolved as peak with a better more Lorentzian lineshape.

Compared to the magnetic field for the phantom the magnetic field in the human brain is highly inhomogeneous see for example and . Consequently the metabolite spectrum exhibits severe spectral overlap lineshape distortion and linebroadening see for example for MRS volume . As a result the overlapping Cr and Cho peaks can not be resolved from peak . In addition the singlet NAA peak can not be fitted accurately because of the lineshape distortion. After de convolution by SPREAD see for example the adjacent Cr and Cho peaks and respectively are very well separated and the lineshape distortion for NAA peak is corrected.

In the illustrated embodiments the effect of eddy current on the lineshape is not included and therefore the lineshape distortion caused by eddy current is not corrected. This may prevent the application of such embodiments to very short echo time when an eddy current effect may be pronounced. However this constraint is very weak for modern scanners equipped with active shielding and therefore the eddy current effects are practically small. In some embodiments the effect of eddy currents is included explicitly.

In the illustrated embodiment additional measurement time for the field mapping images is involved. However the increase in time is only three to eight minutes which is a small portion of the total MRSI measurement time.

In the illustrated embodiments use is made of a standard quadrature coil as the RF receiving antenna. In other embodiments use is made of a multi channel coils as the RF receiving antenna. Such embodiments involve more robust field mapping techniques because the SNR of the images from individual coil components vary dramatically across the field of view.

In another embodiment improved spectral resolution is applied to the human lower leg. The accurate measurement of intramyocellular lipids IMCL in muscle is important for understanding lipid utilization in a variety of diseases such as diabetes. However such measurements can be obscured by overlap with extramyocellular lipids EMCL . Traditionally IMCL has been measured by biopsy. In recent years proton MRS and MRSI have been employed to assess EMCL and IMCL stores in vivo. The spectral lines of EMCL and IMCL depend on both their chemical shifts and the bulk magnetic susceptibility BMS effects of EMCL with the latter being altered by the orientation of the muscle fiber with respect to the external magnetic field B. While the main IMCL peak appears at 1.3 ppm the peak of EMCL may spread in the range of 1.3 1.5 ppm depending on the fiber orientation related to B.

Due to the dual inhomogeneities of the magnetic fields Band local BMS the proton MRS of calf muscle suffer from severe spectral overlap. As a result accurate separation of the spectral peaks of EMCL and IMCL and therefore accurate measurement of IMCL are difficult. The SPREAD method was applied to improve the spectral resolution of proton MRSI acquired on the aforementioned scanner at 3 T.

In this embodiment measurements were on the right legs of two healthy male volunteers. The protocol was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. MR scans were carried out on a 3 T whole body scanner GENERAL ELECTRIC of Fairfield Conn. with a home built bird cage coil inner diameter 14 cm serving as transmitter and receiver. Commercial MRSI sequence with PRESS localization PROBE P CSI was used for MRSI data acquisition. The parameters are as follows Field of View 17 cm 17 cm number of slices 1 slice thickness 12 mm number of phase encoding 32 32 spectral width 4000 Hz number of data points in FID 1024 TR TE 1200 ms 27 ms total scan time 21 min.

Immediately following the MRSI scan MR images were measured for the purpose of field mapping. A commercial MRI sequence 2 dimensional SPGR was used for data acquisition. The parameters are as follows FOV 17 cm 17 cm slice thickness 3 mm number of slices 6 number of TEs 2 TE1 2.3 ms and TE2 5.8 ms TR 500 ms SW 50 MHz flip angle 60 degree. The MRI volume completely covered the MRSI volume and the MRI slices were parallel to MRSI slice. Automatic shimming was turned off. Complex raw data were saved in addition to the conventional images in DICOM format.

Note that the main spectral peak of IMCL from CH group overlapped severely with the main peak of EMCL and the CHpeaks of both EMCL and IMCL not shown . After SPREAD the two main peaks and are better separated and the small peaks of CHfrom IMCL and EMCL respectively can be seen. These two small peaks can be included in the spectral fitting for accurate measurement of IMCL. Peak assignment is based on Machann et al. European Journal of Radiology v 67 pp 275 484 2008 .
