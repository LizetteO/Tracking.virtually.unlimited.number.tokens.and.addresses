This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 139 793 filed Dec. 22 2008 the entirety of which application is expressly incorporated by reference herein.

This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. N0017 07 C 4013 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

Superheterodyne and direct conversion receivers and waveform generators also known as exciters are employed in a wide range of applications. These include but are not limited to radar and communications transceivers. These receivers provide the ability to select a narrower RF band within a wider operational band for signal reception and transmission using detection and modulation circuits implemented at narrower intermediate frequencies bands which are typically lower than the transmit band frequencies and include baseband. The narrower or lower center frequency intermediate frequency bands are better suited to detection and modulation where analog to digital converter digital to analog converter performance is improved and more commonly available. The frequency conversion is accomplished through at least one or more stage of mixing for up conversion and or down conversion. An ability for these receivers is the need for frequency selectivity and or hopping to provide frequency agility of the receivers and exciters within the operational band. Agility relates to the number of frequencies the operational band covered within a band and may also relate to the speed of tuning. The local oscillator synthesizers employed produce the reference signals at an offset from the radio frequency of interest where the offsets are related to the intermediate frequencies. The synthesizer typically adjusts its frequency to address the agility of the receiver but also provide low phase noise and spurious signals which degrade the performance of the receiver.

To address suppression of clutter in radar and generally the suppression of interference and jamming the receiver dynamic range and or the waveform generator s spectral purity have certain requirements. With advancing threats and denser RF environments the ability of prior art frequency agile synthesizers are limited by phase noise and spurious produced and are also more complex than desired. In particular higher performance agile LO synthesis results in significant increase in size weight and power required and limits dynamic range.

The phase noise and spectral purity of LO synthesizers are based low phase noise fixed frequency oscillators for which all synthesized frequencies are synchronized to in order to meet particular frequency accuracy drift and phase coherence requirements. Agile high performance synthesizer typically degrade phase noise by 20 dB to 40 dB over the best available oscillators.

The traditional phase noise performance LO synthesis employs direct RF synthesis techniques includes low phase noise frequency division mixing and switched filtering to develop an ultra low noise frequency agile LO. This approach however has phase noise limitations due to the addition of multiple residual component phase noise sources. Additionally multiple bandpass filters are utilized to reject spurious where settling time in switching filters and related complexity of filters switches and loss recovery amplifiers increases size weight and power consumptions while further limiting phase noise.

Frequency synthesis techniques such as those that use phase locked loop PLL employ frequency fractional division devices within the PLL feedback loop for frequency agile synthesis are subject to both settling time limitations and spurious and noise generated in the fractional dividers which are subsequently amplified at the output.

Direct digital synthesis DDS employing digital to analog DAC devices have undesirable lower than desired performances related to generation of spurious due to amplitude and time skew distortion and due to phase quantization resulting in a large number of spurious signals.

Recently there has been focus brought to architectures and technologies that combine a plurality of LO synthesizer units to yield an improvement of phase noise relative to a single unit. While this approach can reduce uncorrelated noise terms it does not address harmonic or other correlated terms. A simplistic approach results in cost size and weight of a plurality of traditional high performance LO synthesizers can be prohibitive. Other approaches employing tunable oscillators arrays on integrated circuits with frequency injection locking address the size weight and power and complexity of parallel architectures but performance of the individual synthesizers are limited in phase noise and agility.

Accordingly an improved frequency LO synthesizer is desirable in the art that provides improved spectral purity improved frequency agility and size weight and power advantages.

A representative integrated circuit comprises a clock signal generator that generates a clock signal a code pattern generator that generates digital pattern data based on the clock signal and multiple traversal local oscillator synthesizers that are coupled in a cascaded configuration. Each traversal local oscillator synthesizer includes a transversal digital to analog conversion T DAC unit that includes a plurality of registers and a unary modulator Umod array. The T DAC provides frequency selection ranges covering wide operational bands based on the digital pattern data and the clock signal.

Other systems devices methods features of the disclosure will be or will become apparent to one skilled in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such systems devices methods features be included within the scope of the invention and be protected by the accompanying claims.

Exemplary synthesizers are discussed with reference to the figures. Although these systems are described in detail they are provided for purposes of illustration only and various modifications are feasible. In general the exemplary synthesizers address the field of local oscillator synthesis in which improvements to phase noise and spectral purity are desired while also providing the frequency selection ranges covering wide operational bands.

In general the disclosed integrated circuit and method for operation generates a frequency selectable local oscillator reference signal using a digital to analog converting comb filter. The comb filter comprises a transversal digital to analog converter TDAC unit which is comprised of a plurality of amplitude and sign adjustable low resolution digital to analog and clock modulating converters which receive digital signals from a plurality of taps from a digital shift register. The plurality of digital to analog and clock modulating converter outputs are combined on a traveling wave transmission line for generating the output local oscillator signal. Additionally the method of the disclosure combines this with a circular pattern generator and method of programming to implement a discrete form of the SINC filter where the main lobe corresponds to the desired frequency and the zeros correspond to the spurious frequencies.

Clock signal generators that amplify or convert an external sampling clock signal into a common digital shift register clock signal with clock frequency fs and a common unary modulation clock signal which is selected as a multiple of fs 2 a circular code pattern generator that generates digital patterns that repeat within an adjustable number of cycles Ncycle where the maximum cycle length corresponds to the number of available shift register taps and said circular pattern is derived from a quantized sine wave. Such a pattern produces a dominant desired term and Ncycle 1 undesired secondary spurious terms. The apparatus is programmed with amplitude and sign weights to produce the effect of a comb filter centered to pass the desired term and null each of the spurious terms. This produces the desired sine wave local oscillator reference signal ideally without spurious terms since all spurious terms reside at filter comb filter nulls. The absence of spurious at frequencies other than the comb filter nulls results in improved digital to analog conversion direct synthesis of local oscillator signals. Also plurality of digital to analog converters lead to reduction of uncorrelated residual phase noise produced in each thereby providing improved phase noise.

Integrated circuit implementation can further include all the pattern and weight coefficients stored on chip within memory to form a complete synthesizer requiring only the external clock a frequency control word. Each frequency word will look up a unique digital pattern and comb filter. It may also select multiplication of the unary clock for translating the comb filter by multiples of one half the clock frequency. This represents a substantial reduction over prior art in complexity for agile LO synthesis. Implementation of the integrated circuit using high speed transistor technologies such as SiGe CMOS Silicon Germanium Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor can result in a self contained multioctave local oscillator generator integrated circuit over DC to 20 GHz range replacing prior art which is conventionally the size of an rack mounted assembly

Referring to is a block diagram that illustrates a 3 stage superheterodyne multiple stage transceiver system including a transmitter and a receiver having an agile local oscillator system in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. The three stage superheterodyne transceiver system includes a transmitter and a receiver . The exemplary system includes both transmitter and receiver but each can be employed separately as well.

A transmitter waveform generator employs direct digital synthesizer DDS for generating a low intermediate frequency modulated signal that is coupled to an up converter composed of three radio frequency RF sections that include mixers filters that are employed to select desired mixer terms and amplifiers that amplify the selected terms to overcome losses from the mixing operation. The output of the chain produces a higher frequency low power signal that is amplified by a power amplifier which receives signals from the waveform generator and produces amplified signals. The amplified signals are received by an antenna circulator which sends the amplified signals to an antenna for transmission.

Also within the transceiver system can also includes a receiver for amplifying and converting receive RF signals via an antenna . The received RF signals are passed through the antenna circulator to a low noise amplifier which amplifies the received signals. The amplified received signals are passed through down converter composed of another three RF sections having mixers . Similar to the transmitter filters and amplifiers in the receiver are employed to select mixer terms and to overcome losses. At the output of the chain a lower intermediate frequency replica of the radio frequency signals is produced for conversion by IF to digital I Q baseband conversion unit composed of an analog to digital converter for converting analog signals to digitized samples and a baseband converter for producing digitized Inphase and Quadrature I and Q components of the digitized bandpass signal.

The three stage superheterodyne receiver system further includes a first local oscillator a second local oscillator and third local oscillator all of which can include a transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer. The oscillators are coupled to power dividers respectively. The power dividers are coupled to mixers respectively. The transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer is capable of frequency agile generation of local oscillator signals with low phase noise covering a wide instantaneous RF band and is further described in .

The transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer generates local oscillator signal to the power divider and mixers . The inputs to the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer includes a frequency control word a serial or other port for programming on chip memory for storing circular quantized sinewave patterns and for storing comb filter coefficients and a low phase noise fixed reference clock .

The data provide through port includes data associated with a serial path for loading filter and pattern digital data that facilitates synchronizing and triggering the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer . The control word is used by the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer to select a specific code pattern and associated weighting from memory e.g. random access memory RAM and read only memory ROM . The reference clock is generally a low phase noise stable reference sinewave signal produced by a fixed frequency source have low phase noise.

The transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer provides continuous wave mixer reference signals with frequency selection coverage over the transmit and receive bands stepped in frequency increments sufficiently small to enable overlapped coverage by the transceiver of select bands. Common step size of interest range from 10 MHz to 100 MHz and commonly several hundred frequencies can be generated by a single transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer . It should be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that use of higher intermediate frequency capable direct digital synthesizer DDS and analog to digital converter ADC elements within the system of and can allow improved modulation bandwidth and spurious free dynamic range.

The transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer can be used to produce a wide range of local oscillator signals with a wide frequency range of frequencies in uniform steps thereby enabling the transceiver to have a wide operational band supporting multiple applications including frequency hopping systems. The ability to select local oscillator signals can be contained within a single integrated circuit due to the method of the invention which is amenable to low residual phase noise and spurious signals without requiring additional components such as mixers and filters. Therefore with appropriate design transceiver of can exhibit wider bandwidths and employs fewer components within its local oscillator synthesizer which can reside within an integrated circuit. Given that spurious signals are limited to a comb of possible frequencies the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer is also amenable to high dynamic range receivers and waveform generator frequency plan where residual spurious terms given nonideal suppression within the invention can be avoided or out of the pass band.

Table 2 is shown below providing exemplary data where the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer is provided with multiple sets of input clocks and more specifically where a common data clock fs of 1.4 GHz is used in conjunction with 5 umod frequencies derived by frequency multiplication of the 1.4 GHz clocks signal. Also a switched bank of Nyquist band anti aliasing filters nominally five is provide where each filter is centered to pass desired range.

The transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer improves phase noise performance over conventional synthesizers due to the method employing a common low noise source for the data clock fs and U mod clock fumod through amplification splitting and frequency multiplication and short chain elements. The common low noise source includes a common dual clock source and driver that outputs clock signals to the array of digital to analog converter DAC cells on lines and and the short chain elements include a DAC cell array. A shift register is employed to produce an array of delayed replica signals which are weighted by the DAC cells taps to implement a finite impulse response transverse comb filter for selecting the desired frequency. The combining of DAC signals results in coherent addition of the desired signals terms out of each DAC and also noncoherent addition of the uncorrelated residual phase noise terms produced within each DAC cell This renders the noise of the array of DAC cells much smaller than the dual clock source . A reduction of 10 log 10 Ntap in a single sideband phase noise of each cell in units of dBc Hz is thus realized where the number of taps or DAC cells is Ntap. For a 200 tap array a 23 dB reduction in phase noise can be realized.

The primary limiting source within the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer is potentially the distribution buffer drivers for the data clock and umod clock. An integrated circuit implementation employing SiGe Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor HBT transistors is capable of provide low residual phase noise inherent to the known characteristics of this technology.

Thus can be combined with the distributed transversal architecture to enable extremely low expected phase noise from the design because the HBT transistor. A design for a 25 ohm output impedance for results in a low residual phase noise with high slew rates. A simulation of outstanding SiGe clock buffer phase noise has shown a single sideband phase noise floor better than 170 dBc Hz being reached within 10 KHz of the carrier.

Frequency multiplication and or frequency division functions can be implemented in the HBT process to ease system implementation. An example of this amenable to integrated circuit techniques is to employ high speed HBT differential flip flops designed to operate at clock rates as high as 40 GHz within this technology as the building blocks of a counter digital frequency divider configured for division factors typically on the order of 1 through 8 within . These can be the same flip flops employed in forming the high speed circular shift register. Additionally phased lock loops using a wideband voltage controlled oscillator feedback path with frequency divider and phase detector can provide frequency multiplication. These functions within enable a useful range of choices for producing the data clock signal and umod clock signals with frequencies supporting multiple combinations or modes of synthesis which increase the number of frequencies produced.

For example a 10.24 GHz input could be frequency divided to provide a 5.12 GHz Umod clock and then further divided to provide a 1.28 GHz clock for the ternary data patterns. Conversely if the system phase noise floor was less of a concern a lower frequency input reference could be frequency multiplied within the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer to provide the Umod and ternary clock functions.

The transversal agile local oscillator concept which employs a synchronized digital shift register pattern generator also incorporates a synchronization function that enables the synthesizer to control the timing and initial phase state of the local oscillator signal. The local oscillator signal can include a sinusoide with a phase ramp representing the initial phase as an intercept at the initial time step or first sample and a phase increment at each successive sample representing the ramp which may include a saw tooth phase function modulus 180 deg. This phase ramp is implicit to the signal and is not directly generated as is done in conventional direct digital synthesis but rather through means of control of the pattern pattern initialization and TDAC weights. The initial phase can be reset to any of the possible initial phases by means of selecting a delay shift in the circular digital pattern or by modifying the TDAC weights. In a manner similar to direct digital synthesizers the pattern can be initialized with a synchronization reset pulse. This can be added as a feature to the design such as frequency hopping applications.

Conversely a preferred embodiment for this sends a synchronization pulse that resets a counter within the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer . This counter can be used to gate a waveform start trigger sent on lower frequency timing boundaries corresponding to the synchronization pulse. It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that this type of function can be implemented using the standard design libraries.

The clock signal generator receives and generates clock signals based on the reference clock and Umod data from the signal generator unit . The control word is used to select a specific code pattern and associated weighting from memory not shown that is then used by a transversal digital to analog conversion T DAC unit to generate an extremely low phase noise low spurious continuous wave CW LO frequency. The T DAC unit is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 504 976 which is incorporated by reference entirely herein.

The code pattern generator generates digital pattern data that includes a spectrum of a single ternary pattern that contains a desired fundamental frequency as well as spurious separated from the desired output by integer multiples of the step frequency. In general spurious is considered any undesired frequency that is received or manufactured that can interfere with a wireless receiver operation. The spectrum of the ternary pattern can be moved to a higher frequency Nyquist zone if required through use of a Umod clocking function of the T DAC unit . Below is Table 3 with exemplary instantiations of this functionality.

The frequency range supported by the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer are a function of shift register data rate as well as clock rate. The clock signal from the clock signal generator is distributed to the shift registers and Umod array . The shift registers can include ternary shift registers. Simulations in the SiGe CMOS process without layout effects indicate shift register speeds of 30 gigasamples per second GSPS so a conservative estimate of 20 GSPS for the shift registers can support a range of LO frequencies approaching 10 GHz directly. The Umod array provides a sign weighted tap signal where the weighting represents a static sign adjustment unique to each of the tap DAC cell in the array of tap DAC cells . The Umod array further provides a modulation function for production of higher order Nyquist bands. The shift registers Umod array and tap DAC cells are further described in connection with .

The traveling wave distribution of the ternary shift register clock and Umod signals from the shift registers and Umod array has been measured to be highly accurate in the pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor pHEMT based power TDAC design. Simulations of the traveling wave distribution in the SiGe CMOS process have shown that 40 50 GSPS clock distribution is reasonably feasible supporting the 20 30 GHz shift register data rates as well as Umod translation to higher frequency sNyquist zones limited to the same frequency range. Therefore synthesis of LO signals over 20 30 GHz is enabled.

Signal A is related to quantized sinewave pattern sequence and pattern length word signal B is related to clock state and multiplication state and signal C is related comb filter coefficients. Signal A is inputted into serial to parallel converter shift registers A which determines an activated portion of circular register and the number of patterns and cyclic interval on the activated portion of circular register. Signal B is inputted into the signal generator unit that generates reference clock and Umod data based on signal B and send the clock and Umod data to an Ntap circular shift register transversal DAC A. Signal C is inputted into serial to parallel converter shift registers A which determines a transversal filter weight that includes signal and amplitude components of DAC implement weight. The transversal filter weight is inputted into Ntap weight generators .

The plurality of shift registers are arranged in parallel and each parallel register is coupled with a pass gate that when switched on by the code pattern generator electrically couples the parallel register together forming a circular register . In this example the circular register is formed by switching on pass gate A. The pass gate A determines a programmable circular shift length e.g. 5 of the circular register . The pass gate sets a number of patterns e.g. 5 for the programmed cyclic interval e.g. pattern a a a etc. is preloaded onto forward or return or both portions of the circular register . The transversal filter length can extend beyond one cycle by using multiple cycles to provide constant gain and parallel phase nose averaging of the tap DAC cells and higher order zero suppression.

The ternary patterns are suppressed to low levels such as through comb filtering using the circular register . The comb filter is formed by a transversal delay line with a circular return path and tap DAC cells connected to each of the transversal delay taps. Each tap DAC cell also contains modulation logic that takes a signal related as a multiple of half the shift register clock frequency to provide internal higher order Nyquist emphasis. Each tap DAC cell also implements a sign and amplitude weight in accordance with the transversal DAC architecture which can include more than one bit 1 b per tap DAC cell and preferably a 3 level or ternary DAC cell. The array of Digital to Analog converters DACs in the forward path are combined by traveling wave techniques to enable wide bandwidth. The clock distribution is also laid out in a traveling wave fashion as to cancel the delays in the traveling wave DAC line. The method of is amenable to high frequency circular shift register design but requires the array of pass gates to allow the redirection of high speed data to form arbitrary length circular pattern arrays required.

The multiplexed memory read transversal local oscillator synthesizer B uses a short cyclic pattern that can be stored on memory and that produces the desired LO term and known spurious at multiples of a fundamental step frequency set by the clock rate. The tap DAC cells are programmed to implement a comb filter which nulls each of the undesired terms which undesired terms result from 3 b quantization of the digital LO pattern. The output spectrum can contain a few spurious and the spurious are suppressed by the comb filter to the level enabled by tolerance about 80 dBc is desired . Due to the parallelism of the comb filter a 10 log 10 N advantage in the phase noise contribution of the inventions where N number of taps is enabled relative to the fundamental phase noise of each DAC. A return path shift register where a bypass at each tap is enabled allows programming of a 2N sequency to a N tap filter. A monolithic integrated circuit solution is desired where many of these simple patterns are local stored on chip. This solution can use a SiGe implementation.

The synthesizers described above provide a superior approach to the generation of LO signals over traditional synthesizers because the disclosed synthesizers afford smaller size benefits of a monolithic Direct Digital DAC technique without the drawback of performance issues of many spurious terms and degraded phase noise. The 3 b quantization and patterns result in very well controlled intentional spurious signals where filter nulls are planned and no uncontrolled spurious arise outside these nulls. It is also superior to direct synthesis because its integrated filtering provides a significant reduction or elimination of required additional components. In the absence of the disclosed synthesizers a direct synthesis apparatus may include multiple oscillators synthesizers and mixers that result in both size and performance degradation. The disclosed synthesizers provides a direct path thereby avoiding the contribution from multiple components.

A benefit of the disclosed synthesizers is the ability of the comb filter output to exhibit low phase noise due to parallelism in the device. A 10 log 10 N advantage for N taps employed in the filter combined with SiGe technology which is known for low phase noise can enable lower noise than one individual DAC. An advanced simulation of the device shows that the limit to phase noise is the clock driver. A high edge slope clock driver was designed in the SiGe 120 Jazz process and showed a 4 GHz clock with 170 dBc Hz at 100 KHz offset and 155 dBc Hz at IKHz offset. This is superior by a significant margin over any synthesizer available today.

This description has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the disclosure to the precise forms disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The embodiments discussed however were chosen to illustrate the principles of the disclosure and its practical application. The disclosure is thus intended to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to use the disclosure in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variation are within the scope of this disclosure as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly and legally entitled.

The signal generator unit receives a frequency multiplication state command from memory and word source and produces a clock frequency and a Umod frequency at an input of the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer . The generation mode state memory and word source provides control word to the stage transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer which produces synthesized clock signals based on the inputted clock frequency Umod frequency and the control word . The control word looks up the circular pattern and comb filter coefficients for the first stage unit .

The synthesized clock signals are inputted at the data clock input of the second transversal agile local oscillator synthesizers and by a Umod multiplier at the umod clock input. A Umod control word memory and source transmits state data to the Umod multiplier which multiplies the received frequency signal and thereby selects and transmits certain frequency to a Umod input of the second transversal agile local oscillator synthesizers based on control word produced by generation mode state memory and word source . It should be noted that the generation mode state memory and word source receives input instruction at their inputs which generates control word to and based on the input instruction. In general the control word can be produce by way of software or hardware and a user command can be inputted to produce or determine the frequency to produce. The generation mode state memory and word source controls the single stage transversal agile local oscillator synthesizers to enable the cascade to produce the desired frequency.

The second transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer receives synthesized Data clock and Umod clock signals and the input control word . The input control word looks up the circular pattern and comb filter coefficients of the second stage unit .

The control word is produced by a generation mode state word source . The second transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer produces primary RF signals to a filter s such as a Nyquist band pass filter based on the inputted clock frequency Umod frequency and control word .

The control words inputted to the clock synthesizer elements can be set up to produce desired frequencies within a selectable higher order Nyquist bands and can be determined through an equation derived for programming the structure. The equation determines the resulting frequency based on the variables discussed and include pattern truncation effects. Hence as a method of the disclosure equations are used to produce known results for selecting the variables used to also define the state words and which in turn define the output frequency.

The frequencies Fo produced from the second transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer is based on the frequencies Fo produced from the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer which is shown in Equation two 2 shown below.

The cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer can be constructed from low resolution high speed quantized shift registers and modulating and weighted Digital to Analog Converters DACs elements where the quantization is 3 levels or greater. Each DAC is capable of controlling an amplitude and sign unique to each tap representing a coefficient of a filter. Each DAC can also modulate the shift register signal with some multiple of the shift register clock rate to emphasize a particular Nyquist band. The low resolution quantized shift registers being driven by the a synthesized data clock signal allows the cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer to increase the resolution in frequency adjustment. It can also fit within a small area such as on an integrated circuit with a number of taps e.g. 32 taps to form clock dependent delay lines.

The spurious produced are determined primarily by the quantization of the high speed shift register pattern and not by DAC amplitude control linearity out of each tap of the comb filter of the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizers . By the combined effect of the comb filter the quantization spurious is suppressed at the filter nulls while the desired frequency is passed. The pattern circularity or repetition rate defines possible frequencies where both signal and spurious reside. The possible spurious frequencies correspond to the zeros of the comb filters. Since the frequency location is determined by both the circular patterns comb filters and frequency multiplication employed in response to a common reference signal the frequencies of the signals and comb filters zeros are determined by their respective clocks. Hence the comb filter zeros track the spurious frequencies as a function of the instantaneous signal where the clock cycle period may change as a function of time.

Higher order Nyquist bands each with 32 maximum possible frequencies can be selected by selecting a umod clock at the Umod multiplier and employing external Nyquist band pass filters . The output frequency is the combination of fs fumod the pattern comb filter and Nyquist band filter selected. The Umod multiplier is further described in connection with . This has the function of provide Umod clock signals from multiples of the input including 0. The zero state produces a differential signal with a fixed high voltage and low voltage difference that leaves the Umod circuits in a fixed buffering mode passing the signals without modulation.

The cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer can produce a large number of frequencies and with less taps than the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer of . For example the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer can have 400 taps for a 5 MHz steps over a 2 GHz operational bandwidth or 2000 MHz with 1 MHz steps in support of a for example superheterodyne receiver or exciter whereas the cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer can have 32 taps. The cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer can have an order of 32 taps N 32 with possibly frequencies or any number less than 32 over a Nyquist band.

A substantial reduction from 400 taps to 32 taps can be realized with the addition of two 8 tap clock and umod cores. The result device produces low density spurious that are suppressed by comb filter nulls. This is in comparison to the high density spurious that can result from fractional N divider synthesis. Also the phase noise of the TALOS improves by 10 log N where the divider is a cascade which degrades with order N. Hence the TALOS provides much higher performance in a miniaturized synthesizer than current art can achieve.

To increase resolution of the frequency steps from 10 MHz to 5 MHz the generation mode state word source can be programmed to produce shorter length patterns that are used by the cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer to facilitate producing 400 frequencies within the 32 taps for the exemplary two 2 stage cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer but may include any order lower than 32. In correspondence with these sets of patterns and the comb filter selections by the Umod multiplier the clock rate of the shift register at the second transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer is also adjusted by a clock synthesizer from the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer .

Patterns and comb filters can be programmed in the cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer to enable selection of any of the possible frequencies from a set of clock rates umod frequencies and patterns which are stored in memory. The resulting concept supports generation of the fine step size Local Oscillator frequencies of interest.

Table 4 is shown below providing exemplary data of a first stage of a cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer as in where the column DCLK Gen refers to and UCLK Gen refers to .

Table 5 is shown below providing exemplary data of a second stage of a cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer based on receiving data which is a subset of the possibilities shown in Table 4.

Thus the number of local oscillator frequencies produced are then greatly increased as the product of the number of clock frequencies and possible set of single stage and single building block frequencies. The tuning or adjustment of the clock frequency modifies the period of the transversal comb filter core and resulting pattern of the second transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer . It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the clock synthesis can be based on fewer number of clock frequencies which can be employed with shorter length patterns for this function. Additionally the umod frequency can undergo a similar synthesis function of adjustment to provide multiples of the synthesized the clock frequencies generated to enable production of higher order nyquist bands in the second stage.
