The invention relates to the production of glucuronic and glucaric acid through recombinant gene expression.

Metabolic engineering encompassing application of recombinant DNA technology has shown its potential to optimize cellular functions for many purposes recombinant protein production pathway engineering for productivity enhancement and novel pathway design for new product generation. Defined as a sequence of conversions that is not found in host species a novel pathway has been designed and constructed in for the production of 1 3 propanediol C. E. Nakamura and G. M. Whited 2003 . 14 454 459 amorphadiene Nature Biotech 21 pp 796 802 and 1 2 4 butanetriol JACS 125 pp 12998 12999 . In these approaches each step was designed based on enzyme availability the recruited enzyme activities from various organisms were identified and the novel pathways were constructed in by assembling these enzymatic steps. The basic idea behind these examples is to consider proteins including enzymes as interchangeable parts and the term synthetic biology has been used to describe this concept Nature 421 p 118 Nature Chemical Biology 3 pp 521 525 .

D glucaric acid is found in fruits vegetables and mammals and has been studied for cholesterol reduction Z. Walaszek et al. 1996 . 16 673 681 and cancer chemotherapy J. Singh and K. P. Gupta 2003 . 16 9 16 . In a recent report T. Werpy and G. Petersen 2004 . Top Value Added Chemicals From Biomass Vol. I PNNL and NREL D glucaric acid was identified as a Top Value Added Chemicals From Biomass and as a promising starting material for producing new nylons and hyperbranched polyesters. D glucaric acid a highly functionalized compound with four chiral carbons is currently produced by chemical oxidation of D glucose a nonselective and expensive process using nitric acid as the oxidant T. Werpy and G. Petersen 2004 . Top Value Added Chemicals From Biomass Vol. I PNNL and NREL . New catalytic processes using enzymes may lead to higher yield and selectivity. The biological approach for producing glucaric acid could be made by mimicking the existing D glucuronic acid pathway in mammals. However this is an inefficient pathway which consists of more than ten conversion steps starting with D glucose.

Described herein is the cloning and characterization of the first udh genes encoding uronate dehydrogenase. Further described herein is the construction of a novel pathway for the production of either D glucuronic or D glucaric acid in a cell such as an cell by combining biological parts from disparate organisms. A first enzyme myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase Ino1 MIPS produces myo inositol from glucose through glucose 6 phospate as an intermediate Dean Johnson and Henry 1989 . A second enzyme myo inositol oxygenase MIOX converts myo inositol to glucuronic acid. Co expression of these two enzymes in a cell such as an cell enables the production of glucuronic acid from glucose. Uronate dehydrogenase can convert glucuronic acid to glucaric acid Bateman Kosuge et al. 1970 Wagner and Hollman 1976 . As described herein expression of this third gene with INO1 and MIOX enables the production of glucaric acid from glucose. Surprisingly recombinant expression of uronate dehydrogenase increased the flux of the pathway significantly such that high quantities of glucaric acid could be obtained.

Aspects of the invention relate to methods and compositions for the production of glucuronic and glucaric acid through recombinant gene expression in cells. Described herein is the cloning of a gene encoding uronate dehydrogenase an enzyme that converts glucuronic acid to glucaric acid. Novel pathways are described that have been designed and implemented to produce glucuronic and glucaric acid from glucose through recombinant expression of uronate dehydrogenase in combination with myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase and myo inositol oxygenase. This novel pathway represents an unexpectedly efficient new system for producing glucaric acid a molecule with widespread applications ranging from production of nylons and polyester to cancer therapy.

The novel pathways described herein for the production of glucuronic and glucaric acid in cells involve several enzymatic components. A first enzyme myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase Ino1 MIPS encoded by the INO1 gene of produces myo inositol from glucose through glucose 6 phospate as an intermediate Dean Johnson and Henry 1989 . The sequence for example has GenBank accession number NC001142 GeneID 853288 . In yeast myo inositol is a constituent of membrane phospholipids and its derivatives are important for cell signaling. The MIPS substrate glucose 6 phosphate is present in as the result of glucose transport by the PTS system Postma Lengeler et al. 1993 . A second enzyme myo inositol oxygenase MIOX converts myo inositol to glucuronic acid. This enzyme is present primarily in mammalian sources and represents the first step of myo inositol catabolism Charalampous and Lyras 1957 . The mouse sequence for example has GenBank accession number NC000081 GeneID 56727 . Co expression of these two enzymes in a cell such as an enables the production of glucuronic acid from glucose.

The third step in the novel pathway for the production of glucaric acid is the conversion of glucuronic acid to glucaric acid a step that can be performed by uronate dehydrogenase Bateman Kosuge et al. 1970 Wagner and Hollman 1976 . As described in Example 2 genes encoding uronate dehydrogenase were cloned and characterized in order to construct this pathway. As presented in Example 2 uronate dehydrogenase was cloned from pv. tomato DC300 KT2440 and str. C58. The udh gene sequence from has been deposited with GenBank Accession Number EU377538. The DNA and protein sequences of pv. tomato DC300A udh are provided in SEQ ID NOs 1 and 2 respectively. The corresponding genes from and were deposited with Accession Numbers BK006462 DNA SEQ ID NO 23 protein SEQ ID NO 24 and BK006380 DNA SEQ ID NO 25 protein SEQ ID NO 26 respectively. Cloning of uronate dehydrogenase allows identification of uronate dehydrogenase proteins in various species using standard methods of homology searching known in the art such as through a BLAST search.

As described herein coexpression of myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase and myo inositol oxygenase in a cell leads to production of glucuronic acid from glucose. When the cell expressing these enzymes further expresses uronate dehydrogenase this leads to an unexpectedly efficient level of production of glucaric acid from glucose via a three step pathway consisting of 1 production of myo inositol from glucose 2 conversion of myo inositol to glucuronic acid and 3 conversion of glucuronic acid to glucaric acid. Also encompassed by the invention is a two step pathway that bypasses the first step described above and consists of steps 2 and 3. In this particular embodiment a cell that could generate glucose would be used precluding the need to supply glucose to the growth medium of the cell. In some embodiments such a cell is provided with a glucose polymer such as corn starch.

Aspects of the invention relate to cells that recombinantly express at least one of myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase myo inositol oxygenase and uronate dehydrogenase. The invention encompasses any type of cell including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in some embodiments the cell is a bacterial cell such as an cell. In other embodiments the cell is a fungal cell or yeast cell such as a cell. In other embodiments the cell is a mammalian cell such as a mouse cell. It should be appreciated that some cells may express at least one of the enzymes associated with the invention endogenously. In some embodiments a cell will not express any of the enzymes endogenously and will express one two or three of the enzymes recombinantly. In other embodiments a cell will express one of the enzymes endogenously and the other one or two enzymes recombinantly. In other enzymes a cell will express two of the enzymes endogenously and the other one or two enzymes recombinantly.

In some embodiments a cell will express one or more of the genes endogenously and will also express the same one or more genes recombinantly.

In some embodiments genes encoding for myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase myo inositol oxygenase and uronate dehydrogenase are expressed in recombinant expression vectors. As used herein a vector may be any of a number of nucleic acids into which a desired sequence or sequences may be inserted by restriction and ligation for transport between different genetic environments or for expression in a host cell. Vectors are typically composed of DNA although RNA vectors are also available. Vectors include but are not limited to plasmids fosmids phagemids virus genomes and artificial chromosomes.

A cloning vector is one which is able to replicate autonomously or integrated in the genome in a host cell and which is further characterized by one or more endonuclease restriction sites at which the vector may be cut in a determinable fashion and into which a desired DNA sequence may be ligated such that the new recombinant vector retains its ability to replicate in the host cell. In the case of plasmids replication of the desired sequence may occur many times as the plasmid increases in copy number within the host bacterium or just a single time per host before the host reproduces by mitosis. In the case of phage replication may occur actively during a lytic phase or passively during a lysogenic phase.

An expression vector is one into which a desired DNA sequence may be inserted by restriction and ligation such that it is operably joined to regulatory sequences and may be expressed as an RNA transcript. Vectors may further contain one or more marker sequences suitable for use in the identification of cells which have or have not been transformed or transfected with the vector. Markers include for example genes encoding proteins which increase or decrease either resistance or sensitivity to antibiotics or other compounds genes which encode enzymes whose activities are detectable by standard assays known in the art e.g. galactosidase luciferase or alkaline phosphatase and genes which visibly affect the phenotype of transformed or transfected cells hosts colonies or plaques e.g. green fluorescent protein . Preferred vectors are those capable of autonomous replication and expression of the structural gene products present in the DNA segments to which they are operably joined.

As used herein a coding sequence and regulatory sequences are said to be operably joined when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the regulatory sequences. If it is desired that the coding sequences be translated into a functional protein two DNA sequences are said to be operably joined if induction of a promoter in the 5 regulatory sequences results in the transcription of the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not 1 result in the introduction of a frame shift mutation 2 interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequences or 3 interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus a promoter region would be operably joined to a coding sequence if the promoter region were capable of effecting transcription of that DNA sequence such that the resulting transcript can be translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.

When the nucleic acid molecule that encodes any of the enzymes of the claimed invention is expressed in a cell a variety of transcription control sequences e.g. promoter enhancer sequences can be used to direct its expression. The promoter can be a native promoter i.e. the promoter of the gene in its endogenous context which provides normal regulation of expression of the gene. In some embodiments the promoter can be constitutive i.e. the promoter is unregulated allowing for continual transcription of its associated gene. A variety of conditional promoters also can be used such as promoters controlled by the presence or absence of a molecule.

The precise nature of the regulatory sequences needed for gene expression may vary between species or cell types but shall in general include as necessary 5 non transcribed and 5 non translated sequences involved with the initiation of transcription and translation respectively such as a TATA box capping sequence CAAT sequence and the like. In particular such 5 non transcribed regulatory sequences will include a promoter region which includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional control of the operably joined gene. Regulatory sequences may also include enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences as desired. The vectors of the invention may optionally include 5 leader or signal sequences. The choice and design of an appropriate vector is within the ability and discretion of one of ordinary skill in the art.

Expression vectors containing all the necessary elements for expression are commercially available and known to those skilled in the art. See e.g. Sambrook et al. Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989. Cells are genetically engineered by the introduction into the cells of heterologous DNA RNA . That heterologous DNA RNA is placed under operable control of transcriptional elements to permit the expression of the heterologous DNA in the host cell. Heterologous expression of a novel pathway for production of glucaric acid is demonstrated in the Examples section using . The novel glucaric acid production pathway can also be expressed in other bacterial cells archael cells fungi mammalian cells plant cells etc.

In some embodiments two or more of the nucleic acids of the invention may be cloned into the same expression vector or plasmid. As discussed in the Example section in some embodiments the INO1 gene and the MIOX gene are cloned into the same plasmid such as the pRSFD plasmid.

A nucleic acid molecule or nucleic acid molecules that encodes any of the enzymes for producing glucaric acid can be introduced into a cell or cells using methods and techniques that are standard in the art. For example nucleic acid molecules can be introduced by standard protocols such as transformation including chemical transformation and electroporation transduction particle bombardment etc. Expressing the nucleic acid molecule s encoding the enzymes for producing glucaric acid also may be accomplished by integrating the nucleic acid molecule into the genome. Nucleic acid molecule s can be integrated into a cell s genomic DNA using standard techniques well known in the art.

In some embodiments the enzymes associated with the invention are expressed recombinantly in a bacterial cell. Bacterial cells according to the invention can be cultured in media of any type rich or minimal and composition. Example 1 presents an embodiment in which rich media LB media BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. that was supplemented with glucose and induced with IPTG was found to be optimal. As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art routine optimization would allow for use of other types of media including minimal media such as M9 minimal medium. The selected medium can be supplemented with various additional components. Similarly other aspects of the medium and growth conditions may be optimized through routine experimentation. For example pH and temperature are non limiting examples of factors which can be optimized. According to aspects of the invention the liquid cultures used to grow cells can be housed in any of the culture vessels known and used in the art.

Aspects of the invention include strategies to optimize glucaric acid production from a cell. Optimized production of glucaric acid refers to producing a higher amount of glucaric acid following pursuit of an optimization strategy than would be achieved in the absence of such a strategy. One strategy is to optimize expression levels of myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase myo inositol oxygenase and or uronate dehydrogenase through selection of appropriate promoters and ribosome binding sites. In some embodiments this may include the selection and use of high copy number plasmids or low or medium copy number plasmids. The step of transcription termination can also be targeted for regulation of gene expression through the introduction or elimination of structures such as stem loops.

In some embodiments it may be advantageous to use a cell that has been previously optimized for production of glucaric acid. For example it may be optimal to mutate one or more components of the glucaric acid metabolism pathway in the cell prior to the production of glucaric acid so that the cell does not consume the product being produced. In some embodiments screening for mutations that lead to enhanced production of glucaric acid may be conducted through a random mutagenesis screen or through screening of known mutations. In some embodiments shotgun cloning of genomic fragments could be used to identify genomic regions that lead to an increase in glucaric acid production through screening cells or organisms that have these fragments for increased glucaric acid production. In some cases one or more mutations may be combined in the same cell or organism.

Optimization of protein expression may also require in some embodiments that the genes encoding for the enzymes associated with the invention be modified before being introduced into a cell such as through codon optimization for expression in a bacterial cell. Codon usages for a variety of organisms can be accessed in the Codon Usage Database interne site. For example the invention encompasses a mouse MIOX gene that has been synthesized with codon optimization for expression in

In some embodiments protein engineering can be used to optimize expression or activity of one or more of the enzymes associated with the invention. In certain embodiments a protein engineering approach could include determining the three dimensional 3D structure of an enzyme or constructing a 3D homology model for the enzyme based on the structure of a related protein. Based on 3D models mutations in an enzyme can be constructed and incorporated into a cell or organism which could then be screened for an increased production of glucaric acid. In some embodiments glucaric acid production in a cell could be increased through manipulation of enzymes that act in the same pathway as the enzymes associated with the invention. For example in some embodiments it may be advantageous to increase expression of an enzyme or other factor that acts upstream of one of the enzymes associated with the invention. This could be achieved by over expressing the upstream factor using any standard method.

The invention thus involves in one aspect uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides genes encoding those polypeptides functional modifications and variants of the foregoing as well as uses relating thereto. Homologs and alleles of the uronate dehydrogenase nucleic acids of the invention can be identified by conventional techniques. Also encompassed by the invention are nucleic acids that hybridize under stringent conditions to the uronate dehydrogenase nucleic acids described herein. The term stringent conditions as used herein refers to parameters with which the art is familiar. Nucleic acid hybridization parameters may be found in references which compile such methods e.g. J. Sambrook et al. eds. Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 or F. M. Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons Inc. New York. More specifically stringent conditions as used herein refers for example to hybridization at 65 C. in hybridization buffer 3.5 SSC 0.02 Ficoll 0.02 polyvinyl pyrrolidone 0.02 Bovine Serum Albumin 2.5 mM NaHPO pH7 0.5 SDS 2 mM EDTA . SSC is 0.15M sodium chloride 0.015M sodium citrate pH7 SDS is sodium dodecyl sulphate and EDTA is ethylenediaminetetracetic acid. After hybridization the membrane upon which the DNA is transferred is washed for example in 2 SSC at room temperature and then at 0.1 0.5 SSC 0.1 SDS at temperatures up to 68 C.

There are other conditions reagents and so forth which can be used which result in a similar degree of stringency. The skilled artisan will be familiar with such conditions and thus they are not given here. It will be understood however that the skilled artisan will be able to manipulate the conditions in a manner to permit the clear identification of homologs and alleles of uronate dehydrogenase nucleic acids of the invention e.g. by using lower stringency conditions . The skilled artisan also is familiar with the methodology for screening cells and libraries for expression of such molecules which then are routinely isolated followed by isolation of the pertinent nucleic acid molecule and sequencing.

In general homologs and alleles typically will share at least 75 nucleotide identity and or at least 90 amino acid identity to the sequences of uronate dehydrogenase nucleic acid and polypeptides respectively in some instances will share at least 90 nucleotide identity and or at least 95 amino acid identity and in still other instances will share at least 95 nucleotide identity and or at least 99 amino acid identity. The homology can be calculated using various publicly available software tools developed by NCBI Bethesda Md. that can be obtained through the NCBI internet site. Exemplary tools include the BLAST software also available at the NCBI internet site www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . Pairwise and ClustalW alignments BLOSUM30 matrix setting as well as Kyte Doolittle hydropathic analysis can be obtained using the MacVector sequence analysis software Oxford Molecular Group . Watson Crick complements of the foregoing nucleic acids also are embraced by the invention.

In screening for uronate dehydrogenase genes techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as Southern blots Northern blots and amplification protocols such as polymerase chain reaction using primers which hybridize to the sequences presented can be applied.

The invention also includes degenerate nucleic acids which include alternative codons to those present in the native materials. For example serine residues are encoded by the codons TCA AGT TCC TCG TCT and AGC. Each of the six codons is equivalent for the purposes of encoding a serine residue. Thus it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that any of the serine encoding nucleotide triplets may be employed to direct the protein synthesis apparatus in vitro or in vivo to incorporate a serine residue into an elongating uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide. Similarly nucleotide sequence triplets which encode other amino acid residues include but are not limited to CCA CCC CCG and CCT proline codons CGA CGC CGG CGT AGA and AGG arginine codons ACA ACC ACG and ACT threonine codons AAC and AAT asparagine codons and ATA ATC and ATT isoleucine codons . Other amino acid residues may be encoded similarly by multiple nucleotide sequences. Thus the invention embraces degenerate nucleic acids that differ from the biologically isolated nucleic acids in codon sequence due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. The invention also embraces codon optimization to suit optimal codon usage of a host cell.

The invention also provides modified nucleic acid molecules which include additions substitutions and deletions of one or more nucleotides. In preferred embodiments these modified nucleic acid molecules and or the polypeptides they encode retain at least one activity or function of the unmodified nucleic acid molecule and or the polypeptides such as uronate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity. In certain embodiments the modified nucleic acid molecules encode modified polypeptides preferably polypeptides having conservative amino acid substitutions as are described elsewhere herein. The modified nucleic acid molecules are structurally related to the unmodified nucleic acid molecules and in preferred embodiments are sufficiently structurally related to the unmodified nucleic acid molecules so that the modified and unmodified nucleic acid molecules hybridize under stringent conditions known to one of skill in the art.

For example modified nucleic acid molecules which encode polypeptides having single amino acid changes can be prepared. Each of these nucleic acid molecules can have one two or three nucleotide substitutions exclusive of nucleotide changes corresponding to the degeneracy of the genetic code as described herein. Likewise modified nucleic acid molecules which encode polypeptides having two amino acid changes can be prepared which have e.g. 2 6 nucleotide changes. Numerous modified nucleic acid molecules like these will be readily envisioned by one of skill in the art including for example substitutions of nucleotides in codons encoding amino acids 2 and 3 2 and 4 2 and 5 2 and 6 and so on. In the foregoing example each combination of two amino acids is included in the set of modified nucleic acid molecules as well as all nucleotide substitutions which code for the amino acid substitutions. Additional nucleic acid molecules that encode polypeptides having additional substitutions i.e. 3 or more additions or deletions e.g. by introduction of a stop codon or a splice site s also can be prepared and are embraced by the invention as readily envisioned by one of ordinary skill in the art. Any of the foregoing nucleic acids or polypeptides can be tested by routine experimentation for retention of structural relation or activity to the nucleic acids and or polypeptides disclosed herein.

The invention also provides isolated polypeptides encoded by the foregoing uronate dehydrogenase nucleic acids. Such polypeptides are useful for example alone or as fusion proteins to convert glucuronic acid to glucaric acid in vivo or in vitro. Uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides can be isolated from biological samples including tissue or cell homogenates and can also be expressed recombinantly in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems by constructing an expression vector appropriate to the expression system introducing the expression vector into the expression system and isolating the recombinantly expressed protein. Polypeptides can also be synthesized chemically using well established methods of peptide synthesis.

The invention embraces variants of the uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides described above. As used herein a variant of a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide is a polypeptide which contains one or more modifications to the primary amino acid sequence of a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide. Modifications which create a uronate dehydrogenase variant can be made to a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide 1 to reduce or eliminate an activity of a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide 2 to enhance a property of a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide such as the ability to convert glucuronic acid to glucaric acid or protein stability in an expression system or the stability of protein protein binding 3 to provide a novel activity or property to a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide such as addition of an antigenic epitope or addition of a detectable moiety or 4 to provide equivalent or better binding between a uronate dehydrogenase molecule and another molecule e.g. an enzymatic substrate . Modifications to a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide are typically made to the nucleic acid which encodes the uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide and can include deletions point mutations truncations amino acid substitutions and additions of amino acids or non amino acid moieties. Alternatively modifications can be made directly to the polypeptide such as by cleavage addition of a linker molecule addition of a detectable moiety such as biotin addition of a fatty acid and the like. Modifications also embrace fusion proteins comprising all or part of the uronate dehydrogenase amino acid sequence. One of skill in the art will be familiar with methods for predicting the effect on protein conformation of a change in protein sequence and can thus design a variant uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide according to known methods. One example of such a method is described by Dahiyat and Mayo in 278 82 87 1997 whereby proteins can be designed de novo. The method can be applied to a known protein to vary a only a portion of the polypeptide sequence. By applying the computational methods of Dahiyat and Mayo specific variants of a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide can be proposed and tested to determine whether the variant retains a desired conformation.

In general variants include uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides which are modified specifically to alter a feature of the polypeptide unrelated to its desired physiological activity. For example cysteine residues can be substituted or deleted to prevent unwanted disulfide linkages. Similarly certain amino acids can be changed to enhance expression of a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide by eliminating proteolysis by proteases in an expression system e.g. dibasic amino acid residues in yeast expression systems in which KEX2 protease activity is present .

Mutations of a nucleic acid which encode a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide preferably preserve the amino acid reading frame of the coding sequence and preferably do not create regions in the nucleic acid which are likely to hybridize to form secondary structures such a hairpins or loops which can be deleterious to expression of the variant polypeptide.

Mutations can be made by selecting an amino acid substitution or by random mutagenesis of a selected site in a nucleic acid which encodes the polypeptide. Variant polypeptides are then expressed and tested for one or more activities to determine which mutation provides a variant polypeptide with the desired properties. Further mutations can be made to variants or to non variant uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides which are silent as to the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide but which provide preferred codons for translation in a particular host. The preferred codons for translation of a nucleic acid in e.g. are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Still other mutations can be made to the noncoding sequences of a uronate dehydrogenase gene or cDNA clone to enhance expression of the polypeptide. The activity of variants of uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides can be tested by cloning the gene encoding the variant uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide into a bacterial or mammalian expression vector introducing the vector into an appropriate host cell expressing the variant uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide and testing for a functional capability of the uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides as disclosed herein.

The skilled artisan will also realize that conservative amino acid substitutions may be made in uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides to provide functionally equivalent variants of the foregoing polypeptides i.e. the variants retain the functional capabilities of the uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides. As used herein a conservative amino acid substitution refers to an amino acid substitution which does not alter the relative charge or size characteristics of the protein in which the amino acid substitution is made. Variants can be prepared according to methods for altering polypeptide sequence known to one of ordinary skill in the art such as are found in references which compile such methods e.g. J. Sambrook et al. eds. Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 or F. M. Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons Inc. New York. Exemplary functionally equivalent variants of the uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides include conservative amino acid substitutions in the amino acid sequences of proteins disclosed herein. Conservative substitutions of amino acids include substitutions made amongst amino acids within the following groups a M I L V b F Y W c K R H d A G e S T f Q N and g E D.

In general it is preferred that fewer than all of the amino acids are changed when preparing variant polypeptides. Where particular amino acid residues are known to confer function such amino acids will not be replaced or alternatively will be replaced by conservative amino acid substitutions. Preferably 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 residues can be changed when preparing variant polypeptides. It is generally preferred that the fewest number of substitutions is made. Thus one method for generating variant polypeptides is to substitute all other amino acids for a particular single amino acid then assay activity of the variant then repeat the process with one or more of the polypeptides having the best activity.

Conservative amino acid substitutions in the amino acid sequence of uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides to produce functionally equivalent variants of uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides typically are made by alteration of a nucleic acid encoding a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide. Such substitutions can be made by a variety of methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example amino acid substitutions may be made by PCR directed mutation site directed mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel Kunkel 82 488 492 1985 or by chemical synthesis of a gene encoding a uronate dehydrogenase polypeptide.

The invention as described herein has a number of uses some of which are described elsewhere herein. First the invention permits isolation of the uronate dehydrogenase protein molecules. A variety of methodologies well known to the skilled practitioner can be utilized to obtain isolated uronate dehydrogenase molecules. The polypeptide may be purified from cells which naturally produce the polypeptide by chromatographic means or immunological recognition. Alternatively an expression vector may be introduced into cells to cause production of the polypeptide. In another method mRNA transcripts may be microinjected or otherwise introduced into cells to cause production of the encoded polypeptide. Translation of mRNA in cell free extracts such as the reticulocyte lysate system also may be used to produce polypeptide. Those skilled in the art also can readily follow known methods for isolating uronate dehydrogenase polypeptides. These include but are not limited to immunochromatography HPLC size exclusion chromatography ion exchange chromatography and immune affinity chromatography.

The expression of the molecules of the invention may be determined using routine methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These methods include but are not limited to direct RNA amplification reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA real time RT PCR amplification of cDNA hybridization and immunologically based assay methods which include but are not limited to immunohistochemistry antibody sandwich capture assay ELISA and enzyme linked immunospot assay EliSpot assay . For example the determination of the presence of level of nucleic acid molecules of the invention in a subject or tissue can be carried out via any standard nucleic acid determination assay including the polymerase chain reaction or assaying with labeled hybridization probes. Such hybridization methods include but are not limited to microarray techniques.

The invention also provides antibodies against uronate dehydrogenase Udh . In some embodiments the antibodies bind to a polypeptide comprising at least 95 amino acid identity to SEQ ID NO 2. In some embodiments the antibodies bind to a polypeptide that is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule that has at least 95 nucleotide identity with SEQ ID NO 1. In some embodiments the antibodies bind to a polypeptide comprising at least 95 amino acid identity to SEQ ID NO 24. In some embodiments the antibodies bind to a polypeptide that is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule that has at least 95 nucleotide identity with SEQ ID NO 23. In some embodiments the antibodies bind to a polypeptide comprising at least 95 amino acid identity to SEQ ID NO 26. In some embodiments the antibodies bind to a polypeptide that is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule that has at least 95 nucleotide identity with SEQ ID NO 25.

The antibodies of the present invention are prepared by any of a variety of methods including administering a protein fragments of a protein cells expressing the protein or fragments thereof and the like to an animal to induce polyclonal antibodies. The present invention also provides methods of producing monoclonal antibodies to Udh. The production of monoclonal antibodies is performed according to techniques well known in the art. It is well known in the art that only a small portion of an antibody molecule the paratope is involved in the binding of the antibody to its epitope see in general Clark W. R. 1986 The Experimental Foundations of Modern Immunology Wiley Sons Inc. New York Roitt I. 1991 Essential Immunology 7th Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications Oxford . The pFc and Fc regions for example are effectors of the complement cascade but are not involved in antigen binding. An antibody from which the pFc region has been enzymatically cleaved or which has been produced without the pFc region designated an F ab 2 fragment retains both of the antigen binding sites of an intact antibody. Similarly an antibody from which the Fc region has been enzymatically cleaved or which has been produced without the Fc region designated an Fab fragment retains one of the antigen binding sites of an intact antibody molecule. Fab fragments consist of a covalently bound antibody light chain and a portion of the antibody heavy chain denoted Fd. The Fd fragments are the major determinant of antibody specificity a single Fd fragment may be associated with up to ten different light chains without altering antibody specificity and Fd fragments retain epitope binding ability in isolation.

Within the antigen binding portion of an antibody as is well known in the art there are complementarity determining regions CDRs which directly interact with the epitope of the antigen and framework regions FRs which maintain the tertiary structure of the paratope see in general Clark 1986 Roitt 1991 . In both the heavy chain Fd fragment and the light chain of IgG immunoglobulins there are four framework regions FR1 through FR4 separated respectively by three complementarity determining regions CDR1 through CDR3 . The CDRs and in particular the CDR3 regions and more particularly the heavy chain CDR3 are largely responsible for antibody specificity.

It is now well established in the art that the non CDR regions of a mammalian antibody may be replaced with similar regions of nonspecific or heterospecific antibodies while retaining the epitopic specificity of the original antibody. This is most clearly manifested in the development and use of humanized antibodies in which non human CDRs are covalently joined to human FR and or Fc pFc regions to produce a functional antibody. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 816 567 5 225 539 5 585 089 5 693 762 and 5 859 205. Fully human monoclonal antibodies also can be prepared by immunizing mice transgenic for large portions of human immunoglobulin heavy and light chain loci. Following immunization of these mice e.g. XenoMouse Abgenix HuMAb mice Medarex GenPharm monoclonal antibodies can be prepared according to standard hybridoma technology. These monoclonal antibodies will have human immunoglobulin amino acid sequences and therefore will not provoke human anti mouse antibody HAMA responses when administered to humans. Thus as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art the present invention also provides for F ab 2 Fab Fv and Fd fragments chimeric antibodies in which the Fc and or FR and or CDR1 and or CDR2 and or light chain CDR3 regions have been replaced by homologous human or non human sequences chimeric F ab 2 fragment antibodies in which the FR and or CDR1 and or CDR2 and or light chain CDR3 regions have been replaced by homologous human or non human sequences chimeric Fab fragment antibodies in which the FR and or CDR1 and or CDR2 and or light chain CDR3 regions have been replaced by homologous human or non human sequences and chimeric Fd fragment antibodies in which the FR and or CDR1 and or CDR2 regions have been replaced by homologous human or non human sequences. The present invention also includes so called single chain antibodies domain antibodies and heavy chain antibodies.

It should be appreciated that the genes encoding uronate dehydrogenase myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase and myo inositol oxygenase can be obtained from a variety of sources. In the embodiments discussed in the Example section presented herein the myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase enzyme is encoded by a gene from INO1 the myo inositol oxygenase enzyme is encoded by a mouse gene MIOX and the uronate dehydrogenase enzyme is encoded by a or gene udh . As one of ordinary skill in the art would be aware homologous genes for these enzymes exist in many species and can be identified by homology searches for example through a protein BLAST search available at the NCBI internet site www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . Genes encoding for these enzymes can be PCR amplified from DNA from any source which contains the given enzyme for example using degenerate primers as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments the gene encoding for a given enzyme can be synthetic. Any means of obtaining the genes encoding for the enzymes discussed here are compatible with constructing the pathways of the instant invention.

A synthetic pathway has been constructed for the production of glucuronic and glucaric acids from glucose in . Co expression of the genes encoding myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase Ino1 from and myo inositol oxygenase MIOX from mouse led to production of glucuronic acid through the intermediate myo inositol. Glucuronic acid concentrations up to 0.3 g L were measured in the culture broth. The activity of MIOX was rate limiting resulting in the accumulation of both myo inositol and glucuronic acid as final products in approximately equal concentrations. Inclusion of a third enzyme uronate dehydrogenase Udh from facilitated the conversion of glucuronic acid to glucaric acid. The activity of this recombinant enzyme was more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of Ino1 and MIOX and increased overall flux through the pathway such that glucaric acid concentrations in excess of 1 g L were observed. This represents a novel microbial system for the biological production of glucaric acid a top value added chemical from biomass.

All molecular biology manipulations were performed according to standard practices 32 . The INO1 gene encoding myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase Ino1 also known as MIPS was PCR amplified from a genomic DNA preparation of using the following primers forward 5 ATGACAGAAGATAATATTGCTC 3 SEQ ID NO 3 reverse 5 CTACAACAATCTCTCTTCG 3 SEQ ID NO 4 . EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites included in the 5 ends of the primers are underlined. The mouse MIOX gene encoding myo inositol oxygenase was synthesized with codon optimization for expression in by DNA 2.0 Menlo Park Calif. based on GenBank Accession Number AF197127. Optimization of the 858 nucleotide 286 codon sequence was performed by the vendor with the results summarized as follows 19.2 of the nucleotides were altered affecting 153 of the 286 codons 53.5 . Among the optimized codons 144 94.1 were only altered at the third nucleotide position. All three nucleotides were changed in 3 of the codons. The synthetic gene was received as plasmid pJ2 MIOX. EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites were included in the 5 and 3 ends of the gene respectively. A sequence alignment of the mouse MIOX gene and its synthesized version with codon optimization for expression in is presented in . Both genes were sub cloned into the IPTG inducible plasmids pMMB206 25 and pTrc99A 2 to confirm activity of the expressed enzymes. The resulting plasmids were designated pMMB INO1 pTrc INO1 pMMB MIOX and pTrc MIOX. For co expression of both genes the pRSFDuet 1 vector from Novagen containing two T7 promoters was used Gibbstown N.J. . The INO1 gene was sub cloned into the first position using the EcoRI and HindIII sites producing plasmid pRSFD IN. To introduce the MIOX gene into the second position the HindIII site of pJ2 MIOX was end filled using Klenow enzyme prior to digestion with EcoRI. pRSFD IN was first digested with XhoI and end filled and then digested with the EcoRI compatible MfeI prior to ligation with the MIOX gene fragment. The resulting plasmid was designated as pRSFD IN MI. Isolation of the udh gene encoding uronate dehydrogenase from GenBank Accession Number EU377538 is presented in Example 2. The udh gene from was sub cloned into pTrc99A to produce pT1053 hereafter referred to as pTrc udh as described 40 .

Functional expression of the INO1 MIOX and udh genes was confirmed through in vitro assays of enzyme activity. Crude lysates were prepared by first re suspending cell pellets from 1 2 mL culture in 100 200 l 10 mM Tris Cl pH 8.0 with 1 mg mL lysozyme. Cell solutions were lysed by alternating freezing in liquid nitrogen with thawing in 30 40 C. water for 5 cycles. The resulting solutions were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm at 4 C. for 15 minutes to remove insolubles. The total protein concentration of lysates was determined using the Bradford method 11 .

Assays for myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase activity were performed as described previously 1 6 . Briefly glucose 6 phosphate substrate was converted to myo inositol 1 phosphate in a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris acetate pH 7.5 0.8 mM NAD 14 mM NHCl 5 mM mercaptoethanol and 5 mM glucose 6 phosphate. Reactions were initiated with the addition of lysate and incubated for 1 hr at 37 C. Reactions were terminated with the addition of 0.4 volume 20 trichloroacetic acid. To quantitate product inorganic phosphate was removed from the myo inositol 1 phospate by oxidation with equal volume 0.2 M NaIO. Excess periodate was destroyed with the addition of equal volume 1 M NaSO. Control reactions were established without glucose 6 phosphate and without addition of periodate.

Assays for myo inositol oxygenase activity were performed as described previously 4 30 31 . The reaction buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris Cl pH 8.0 2 mM L cysteine 1 mM Fe NH SO and 60 mM myo inositol. Samples were pre incubated without substrate for 10 minutes at 30 C. to activate the MIOX enzyme. Reactions were incubated for 1 hr at 30 C. then terminated with the addition of 1 10 volume 30 trichloroacetic acid. The glucuronic acid produced was quantified using an orcinol reagent 13 . The reagent consisted of 40 mg orcinol in 10 mL concentrated HCl containing 5.4 mg FeCl. One volume sample was mixed with two volumes orcinol reagent and incubated for 30 minutes in boiling water. After cooling to room temperature absorbance at 670 nm was measured to determine glucuronic acid concentration. Control reactions were established without myo inositol to account for background.

Assays for uronate dehydrogenase activity were performed by monitoring NADH co factor generation at 340 nm as described previously 35 40 . The reaction mixture contained 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 2.5 mM glucuronic acid 0.9 mM NAD and bacterial lysate prepared as described above.

Cultures were grown in LB medium supplemented with 10 g L glucose and induced with IPTG as indicated in Results. An inoculum was prepared in LB medium and 1 or 2 v v was used to inoculate 250 mL baffled flasks containing 50 or 100 mL of medium. The cultures were incubated at 30 C. and 250 rpm with periodic sampling to determine cell density and product concentration in the culture medium.

Metabolites including glucuronic acid and glucaric acid were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC . For glucaric acid assays samples were pre treated as previously described 28 40 to separate glucaric acid from other metabolites including glucuronic acid. Briefly boronic acid affinity gel Affi gel boronate gel Bio Rad Laboratories Hercules Calif. which has an affinity for the coplanar adjacent cis hydroxyl groups present in glucaric acid 28 was mixed with samples and washed with 80 mM potassium phosphate 20 mM boric acid buffer pH 7.0 . Glucaric acid was eluted with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. The eluate was neutralized by adding 10 M NaOH and then analyzed by HPLC. HPLC analyses were performed on an Agilent 1100 series instrument equipped with an Aminex HPX 87H column 300 mm 7.8 mm Bio Rad Laboratories Hercules Calif. and refractive index and diode array detectors under the following conditions mobile phase 5 mM sulfuric acid in water flow rate 0.5 mL min injection volume 50 L temperature 55 C. UV wavelength 210 nm.

The use of myo inositol 1 phosphate synthase Ino1 from to produce high concentrations of myo inositol through fermentation has been previously reported 15 . Product titers up to 21 g L were obtained under high cell density fed batch fermentations operated for 54 hrs. To confirm Ino1 performance in shake flasks the corresponding gene was amplified inserted into a compatible vector then sub cloned into both high and medium copy plasmids for expression in the common laboratory strain DH10B. Plasmid pTrc INO1 contains the modified ColE1 replicon that results in copy numbers of several hundred while pMMB INO1 is based on the RSF1010 replicon with a copy number of the order of 10. Two plasmids were evaluated to explore the potential for co expression of the INO1 and MIOX genes in a single strain using compatible vectors. In vitro activity of 344 nmol hr mg and 128 nmol hr mg was measurable for cultures harboring pTrc INO1 and pMMB INO1 respectively and incubated at 30 C. indicating successful expression of the enzyme Table 1 . However only expression from the high copy plasmid resulted in accumulation of measurable quantities of myo inositol in the culture medium 0.37 g L. Activity was also a strong function of temperature with none detectable for cultures grown at 37 C. myo Inositol production was also tested in M9 minimal medium. It was postulated that growth in minimal medium with glucose as the only carbon source might increase glucose flux and accordingly increase myo inositol production. However only half the amount of myo inositol was produced suggesting that while glucose flux may indeed be higher the Ino1 enzyme expressed under these conditions does not compete as effectively against glycolysis for substrate. Subsequent experiments were conducted in LB medium supplemented with glucose.

MIOX is a protein of primarily eukaryotic origin and the homologues from human mouse rat and pig have been best characterized 3 4 30 31 . myo Inositol oxygenase MIOX has been functionally expressed in and purified for characterization of the enzyme s properties however to our knowledge mammalian MIOX has not been used in a whole cell recombinant system to produce glucuronic acid. The mouse version of the enzyme had been found to have the most favorable properties upon expression in 3 and was chosen for investigation. A synthetic version of the gene was purchased from DNA 2.0 with codon optimization for . This gene was also sub cloned into both the high copy and low copy vectors used to evaluate Ino1 activity in DH10B. MIOX activity was initially evaluated at 37 C. since the enzyme is of mammalian origin.

The MIOX enzyme is known to require Fe and cysteine for activation in vitro 4 . The addition of these compounds to the culture medium did not improve the expression of the enzyme from pTrc MIOX as measured in the in vitro assay but rather resulted in a decrease in activity Table 2 . Glucuronic acid was still measured in the culture medium though at a lower concentration. The observed decrease in enzyme activity coincided with a significant decrease in cell density indicating toxicity of these compounds to the host. As reported previously 30 31 MIOX activity is inhibited by Fe and cysteine at high concentrations. While the extracellular concentrations were set at a level that activates the enzyme in the in vitro assay the corresponding intracellular concentrations are unknown. It was also reported previously that inclusion of myo inositol in the culture medium improved soluble expression of MIOX in 3 . This behavior was also observed herein noting a sharp decrease in activity of the enzyme when expressed in the absence of myo inositol supplementation Table 2 . One striking feature of recombinant MIOX is its apparent instability 3 . High activity was observed in samples taken during exponential phase 6 hrs after inoculation but dropped substantially in stationary phase 24 hrs after inoculation Table 2 . The background activity of the assay as measured in control samples containing empty pTrc99A plasmid generally increases with time. Note that the high background of the assay results from the non specificity of the orcinol reagent which is known to react with other biological compounds though to a smaller extent. As a result the assay may not be reliable for precise quantification of enzyme activity. However the differences observed between samples with and without myo inositol and between samples with myo inositol at early and late time points are sufficiently large that the trends can be considered significant. Neither in vitro enzyme activity nor in vivo production of glucuronic acid was observed in cultures containing the lower copy pMMB MIOX construct suggesting that high expression levels are required to achieve measurable MIOX activity. Because INO1 is only actively expressed at 30 C. in vivo MIOX performance was also evaluated at this temperature from the high copy plasmid. A comparable amount of glucuronic acid 0.40 g L was produced after 24 hr in culture with titers doubling to 0.78 g L after 48 hr.

Production of glucuronic acid from glucose requires the co expression of both INO1 and MIOX in the same strain. The compatible plasmids pTrc99A and pMMB206 were both investigated with the expectation that a doubly transformed strain containing either pTrc INO1 and pMMB MIOX or pMMB INO1 and pTrc MIOX could be used for production. However our results indicated that reasonable in vivo activities as determined by accumulation of each desired product in the culture medium were only achievable with expression of both genes from high copy plasmids. To address this issue we introduced both enzymes into the high copy pRSFDuet vector which contains a pair of multi cloning sites each behind a T7 promoter. Enzyme activities were confirmed as described previously and expression was verified by SDS PAGE data not shown . In this manner an IPTG concentration of 0.1 mM was determined to be preferred. The host strain was also changed from DH10B to BL21 DE3 to enable expression from the T7 promoter. We had previously observed that DH10B was incapable of consuming glucuronic acid for growth data not shown . BL21 DE3 can metabolize glucuronic acid however its consumption appeared to be subject to catabolite repression data not shown . Therefore cultivation of the strain in excess glucose prevents consumption of the desired product.

The BL21 DE3 strain carrying pRSFD IN MI was capable of producing glucuronic acid from glucose though to levels of only 270 mg L . The culture profile shows that glucuronic acid was present after 24 hrs with no intermediates detectable and the concentration increased by 50 in 4 days. However after 48 hr significant quantities of myo inositol appeared in the culture medium. myo Inositol continued to accumulate in the medium and was present in concentrations slightly higher than the desired end product glucuronic acid by the end of the experiment. The final glucuronic acid concentration 0.27 g L was lower than that observed with direct conversion of myo inositol in the DH10B pTrc MIOX system above 0.78 g L . The accumulation of myo inositol suggests that MIOX activity is the limiting factor in production of high concentrations of glucuronic acid. In vitro assays confirmed that Ino1 activity was significantly higher than the vector only control throughout the course of the experiment with only marginal background activity appearing after 3 days data not shown . In contrast MIOX activity was only slightly higher than background after 1 day and was subsequently indistinguishable from background. This is consistent with the results summarized previously Table 2 that indicate that MIOX activity drops sharply after 24 hrs. Additionally it is likely that the activity of MIOX in this system is limited by the concentration of myo inositol produced by Ino1. While an extracellular supplementation of 60 mM 10.8 g L myo inositol does not mean the intracellular concentration is also this high it is reasonable to suspect that the intracellular concentrations of myo inositol that result from Ino1 activity are likely to fall short of the equivalent concentration.

Example 2 reveals cloning and characterization of the gene encoding uronate dehydrogenase activity from pv. tomato DC3000 40 . The udh gene was found to be very well expressed in resulting in high enzyme activities. For the production of glucaric acid we utilized a previously constructed vector harboring the udh gene in pTrc99A which is compatible with pRSFD IN MI. Both vectors were introduced into BL21 DE3 to construct an strain carrying INO1 MIOX and udh. Productivity of this strain was measured under several different induction conditions Table 3 . To our surprise up to 1 g L of glucaric acid was produced although only 0.27 g L of glucuronic acid was previously observed in the system harboring the first two genes. Under induction conditions identical to those previously used for glucuronic acid Table 3 Condition A 0.72 g L of glucaric acid was produced. To further characterize the system enzyme activities in crude lysates were measured after each day of culture . Udh activity was highest more than two orders of magnitude higher than Ino1 activity and three orders of magnitude higher than MIOX activity. The high activity of Udh thus appears to pull glucose flux through the glucaric acid pathway leading to a relatively higher titer of glucaric acid. In these samples MIOX activity does not appear to decrease over time as observed previously however the magnitude of the activity remains quite low. Additionally the first data point here is after one day when MIOX activity was previously shown to have decreased significantly from that observed during exponential growth Table 2 . No glucuronic acid was detected after three days culture time while myo inositol accumulated confirming that the MIOX catalyzed step is limiting.

The three induction conditions tested resulted in glucaric acid concentrations that ranged from 0.72 to 1.13 g L. In general higher induction levels i.e. higher IPTG concentration resulted in a higher yield of glucaric acid on glucose but lower product concentration compare for example Conditions A and B in Table 3 . Higher induction levels also led to less glucose consumption and a lower cell density indicating a metabolic burden associated with higher expression of the three enzymes. However in the case of lower glucose consumption rate a higher fraction of glucose flux was directed towards glucaric acid production versus biomass. We also observed that poorer aeration resulting from doubling the total culture volume from 50 to 100 mL in 250 mL baffled flasks led to a decrease in the glucaric acid titer by half while growth was not affected data not shown . This reduced titer is likely attributed to the fact that MIOX the enzyme for the limiting step uses molecular oxygen as a co substrate 12 38 . Finally production of glucaric acid was tested in M9 minimal medium however a negligible amount of glucaric acid was produced.

Demonstrated herein is the assembly of a biosynthetic pathway for the production of glucaric acid using enzymes from three disparate sources Ino1 from MIOX from mouse and Udh from . An endogenous phosphatase also participates in the pathway. The suhB gene product of has been shown to possess inositol monophosphatase activity in vitro and is therefore a reasonable candidate for this endogenous activity 23 . This pathway is attractive from a thermodynamics perspective since the standard free energy changes G for all three steps as estimated by group contribution theory 21 24 and considering molecular oxygen as the ultimate oxidant are all negative 14.3 Kcal mol for the glucose to myo inositol step 86.8 Kcal mol for the myo inositol to glucuronic acid step 55.9 Kcal mol for the glucuronic to glucaric acid step. However as Khosla and Keasling have indicated 18 metabolic engineering is more than simply recruiting various enzymes. It also involves global optimization of metabolic flux when perturbations such as the introduction of new pathways into a host organism are made. Issues of metabolic burden associated with the maintenance of plasmids and expression of plasmid encoded genes are of particular interest in this case 9 10 17 . In our system a detectable amount of glucuronic acid was produced in vivo only by high copy number plasmids. Glucose 6 phosphate the first substrate should not be limiting for central metabolism because LB medium supplemented with excess glucose was used for growth. Therefore it appears that high expression levels of the recombinant genes are needed in order to compete with the fast and robust glycolysis pathway and to divert glucose 6 phosphate towards glucuronic acid. The result that only small amounts of myo inositol and no detectable amount of the organic acids was produced in M9 medium implies that when glucose is the sole carbon and energy source almost all of the substrate enters endogenous cellular metabolism. This competition may also explain why the yield of glucaric acid on glucose during the first two days of the process when glucose concentration is higher in the medium is generally higher than that of the later days when the concentration is lower data not shown . The requirement for myo inositol to achieve high MIOX activity suggests that low productivity from the Ino1 enzyme may ultimately be the limitation towards formation of the organic acids in M9 medium. Alternatively MIOX may be poorly expressed in minimal medium. It should be noted that previous studies with Ino1 have resulted in high levels of myo inositol production in an alternative chemically defined medium and also employing a high copy number plasmid for gene expression however these experiments were conducted in larger scale fed batch fermentations for several days 15 . During the initial batch period prior to the onset of glucose feeding approximately 10 hours the myo inositol concentration was less than 1 g L. Thus it is worth exploring the extent to which cultivation under fed batch conditions could improve the productivity of our system.

Plasmid copy number is not the only factor related to expression level that affects the performance of our synthetic system. As shown in Table 3 increasing the inducer concentration to increase expression resulted in lower product concentration. IPTG concentrations below 0.05 mM did not improve glucaric acid production even though glucose consumption rate and growth rate were enhanced due to the reduced metabolic burden data not shown . growth is better at 37 C. than at 30 C. and the activity of the rate limiting enzyme MIOX should be higher at 37 C. However fermentation was performed at 30 C. because Ino1 was only functionally expressed at this lower temperature. Considering the reported unusual thermal instability of Udh 7 35 a temperature lower than 30 C. may be better for its activity however we observed that the Udh activity at 30 C. was much higher than that of either Ino1 or MIOX and selected 30 C. as the culture temperature to maximize the functional expression of Ino1.

In considering overall limitations on productivity of this system potential inhibition by intermediates in the pathway should be examined. MIOX from hog kidney was reported to be inhibited in vitro by D glucaric acid but not by D glucuronate and D glucuronolactone 30 31 . Given that MIOX activity dropped sharply at the stationary phase even in the absence of D glucaric acid Table 2 low MIOX activity is more likely due to its intrinsic instability than inhibition by intermediates 3 . It should also be noted that we did not overexpress the suhB gene or a homologous phosphatase. However no myo inositol 1 phosphate was detected among the culture products while myo inositol did accumulate. Therefore we conclude that the phosphatase activity is not limiting flux through the pathway. also contains the D glucarate catabolic pathway 16 . Indeed the ability of to consume D glucarate as the sole carbon source for growth was used to develop a screen to identify uronate dehydrogenase activity 40 . BL21 DE3 can also metabolize D glucuronic acid. However the consumption of both organic acids appears to be subject to catabolite repression preventing the undesirable loss of products in the presence of glucose data not shown . The theoretical limit of D glucaric acid titer therefore seems to be determined by the toxicity of the acids and the kinetics of each step. growth and glucose consumption were not observed to be affected by the addition of potassium glucarate and sodium glucuronate at concentrations as high as 10 g L data not shown thus there is room for improvement of titers by focusing on improving the kinetics of the rate limiting steps. Further optimization for enhancing glucose flux to this synthetic pathway can entail recruiting better enzymes from different sources engineering these enzymes and down regulating the competing pathways.

Uronate dehydrogenase has been cloned from pv. tomato DC3000 KT2440 and str. C58. The genes were identified by using a novel complementation assay employing an mutant incapable of consuming glucuronate as the sole carbon source but capable of growth on glucarate. A shotgun library of was screened in the mutant by growing transformed cells on minimal medium containing glucuronic acid. Colonies that survived were evaluated for uronate dehydrogenase which is capable of converting glucuronic acid to glucaric acid. In this manner a 0.8 Kb open reading frame was identified and subsequently verified as udh. Homologous enzymes were identified in and based on a similarity search of the sequenced genomes. Recombinant proteins from each of the three organisms expressed in were purified and characterized. For all three enzymes the turnover number k was higher for glucuronate as a substrate than for galacturonate however the Michaelis constant K was lower for galacturonate. The enzyme was found to have the highest rate constant k 1.9 10on glucuronate which was more than 2 fold higher than both of the enzymes.

Aldohexuronate catabolism in bacteria is reported to involve two different pathways one initiating with an isomerization step and the other with an oxidation step. In the isomerization pathway aldohexuronate glucuronate galacturonate is isomerized to ketohexuronate by uronate isomerase and ultimately degraded to pyruvate and 3 phosphoglyceraldehyde. The isomerization pathway has been previously reported to occur in bacteria including 7 18 and 15 9 23 and 28 . In the oxidation pathway aldohexuronate is oxidized to aldohexarate by uronate dehydrogenase and further catabolized to pyruvate 2 5 7 9 18 19 24 . Uronate dehydrogenase Udh the key enzyme of this pathway has been investigated in two plant pathogen bacteria and . To date only limited studies pertaining to the properties of Udh have been reported in the literature 3 6 38 43 and no sequence has yet been identified. Udh is classified as an NAD linked oxidoreductase EC 1.1.1.203 with a total molecular weight of about 60 000. It is a homo dimer composed of two subunits of about 30 000 molecular weight each 38 . Udh is a thermally unstable reversible enzyme with an optimum pH of about 8.0 3 6 38 .

In MG1655 with the isomerization pathway for aldohexuronate catabolism glucuronate is transported by an aldohexuronate transporter encoded by exuT and converted to fructuronate by uronate isomerase encoded by uxaC 22 30 . Fructuronate is transferred to the Entner Doudoroff pathway to be utilized as an energy source via 2 keto 3 deoxy 6 phospho gluconate 7 27 31 32 . Therefore MG1655 with an uxaC deletion can not use glucuronate as a carbon source. In this same strain glucarate is converted to 5 keto 4 deoxy D glucarate by D glucarate dehydratase encoded by gudD and then transferred to glycolysis via pyruvate or 2 phosphoglycerate 27 33 . Recently a number of bacterial genome sequences have been published including those of the Udh containing pv. tomato DC3000 and str. C58 4 10 . A shotgun library of was constructed to identify the gene encoding Udh. Screening for Udh was conducted in 1655 uxaC. Since uronate dehydrogenase converts glucuronate to glucarate uxaC strains harboring the shotgun library of that can grow in a minimal medium containing glucuronate as a sole carbon source may carry the gene encoding Udh. Once an initial Udh is identified from a BLAST homology search may lead to the identification of Udhs from other bacteria.

The reaction mixture for producing glucarate from glucuronate by Udh consisted of 20 mM glucuronate 21.6 mM NAD 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 and bacterial lysate prepared as described above. The enzyme reaction was performed by addition of either crude lysate or purified proteins to the reaction mixture and incubation at room temperature for 60 minutes then stopped by addition of 1M sodium hydroxide. Glucarate was separated from the reaction mixture using a column packed with boronic acid affinity gel Affi gel boronate gel Bio Rad Laboratories Hercules Calif. USA which is able to bind to the coplanar adjacent cis hydroxyl groups of glucarate 29 . Glucuronate can not bind to the gel due to its trans diol groups. After loading the Affi gel column with reaction mixture the column was washed with 80 mM potassium phosphate 20 mM boric acid buffer pH 7.0 then glucarate was eluted by the addition of 0.1 M HCl. The eluent was neutralized by the addition of 5 M NaOH then analyzed by LC MS using an Agilent 1100 series LC MSD Agilent Technologies US equipped with an Aminex HPX 87H column 300 7.8 mm Bio Rad Laboratories Hercules Calif. USA and an electron spray ionization detector. Mass spectra were obtained in both the positive and negative ion detection modes.

The udh gene sequence from has been deposited with GenBank Accession Number EU377538 nucleic acid sequence is SEQ ID NO 1 amino acid sequence is SEQ ID NO 2 . The corresponding genes from and were deposited with Accession Numbers BK006462 DNA SEQ ID NO 23 protein SEQ ID NO 24 and BK006380 DNA SEQ ID NO 25 protein SEQ ID NO 26 respectively.

Bacterial lysates for enzymatic analysis were prepared by the freeze thaw method. strains harboring udh genes were grown overnight in LB medium containing 0.1 mM IPTG Isopropyl D 1 thiogalactopyranoside . Pellets were re suspended in 1 mg mL lysozyme solution and incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspensions were frozen in liquid nitrogen then thawed in a 37 C. water bath. This step was repeated five times. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm at 4 C. for 15 min and the supernatant was used for enzymatic analysis. Udh activities on glucuronate were measured by monitoring NADH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced generation at 340 nm 38 . The reaction mixture was consisted of 2.5 mM glucuronate 0.9 mM NAD nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of lysate to the reaction mixture at room temperature and monitored. For determination of the optimum pH for Udh activity the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 6.5 to 9.9 by the addition of HCl or NaOH solutions. The total protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method Bradford 1976 Anal Biochem 72 248 54 . Specific activities were indicated as units per milligram of total protein 1 U 1 mol NADH generated min . Chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. USA .

The screen established to identify the gene corresponding to Udh activity in utilized a mutant strain of MG1655. A deletion of uxaC prevents growth on glucuronate while retaining the ability to grow on glucarate as a sole carbon source. Since Udh catalyzes the conversion of glucuronate to glucarate 3 38 MG1655 uxcaC clones harboring udh genes from a genomic library should grow on glucuronate as the sole carbon source. DH10B and pTrc99A were used as the host strain and plasmid vector respectively for initial construction of the genomic library. A library plasmid pool was prepared from the DH10B clone pool and then used to transform the uxaC strain. Transformed uxaC clones were incubated on M9 minimal agar containing glucuronate for 4 days at 30 C.

From ten agar plates 28 clones were selected for further screening each of which contained an inserted fragment of 2 5 kb. From these 8 clones with different sized inserts were sequenced for comparison with the genome sequence GenBank Accession Number NC004578 . Six of these clones included iolE iolB or both of them while one clone contained the unassigned PSPTO1053 open reading frame. The final clone included a chimera of the iolEB and PSPTO1053 regions. The open reading frames from the library fragments were PCR amplified and inserted into expression vector pTrc99A yielding plasmids pTiolE pTiolB pTiolEB and pT1053. Clones containing these vectors were used to determine which gene corresponded to uronate dehydrogenase activity. MG1655 the uxaC derivative and four uxaC clones transformed with the candidate genes were incubated on M9 minimal agar containing glucuronate as the sole carbon source. Wild type uxaC pTiolB uxaC pTiolEB and uxaC pT1053 strains grew on M9 glucuronate agar while the uxaC pTrc99A and uxaC pTiolE strains did not. Therefore iolB and PSPTO1053 were responsible for growth on glucuronate as the sole carbon source identifying them as candidate udh genes.

To further discriminate between the two candidate genes plasmids pTiolB and pT1053were used to transform DH10B to express the recombinant genes. The resulting clones were grown in LB medium with 0.1 mM IPTG. Analysis of Udh activity in crude lysates from these two clones suggested that the strain harboring pT1053 exhibits Udh activity but not pTiolB . The assay employed glucuronate as a substrate and monitored production of NADH at 340 nm. Consequently the 828 by PSPTO1053 gene was deduced to encode uronate dehydrogenase. The gene is hereafter referred to as udh and was registered to Genbank ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Genbank as Accession Number EU377538 nucleic acid sequence is SEQ ID NO 1 amino acid sequence is SEQ ID NO 2 .

The translated protein sequence of udh from was analyzed using BLASTP from NCBI ncbi.nlm.nih.gov blast to identify putative homologues. The Udh activity of has been studied previously 5 6 43 . The translation of open reading frame Atu3143 of had the highest sequence identity of 47.8 and was considered a candidate for a homologous Udh. Another candidate open reading frame PP1171 of KT2440 was also found to have high similarity to Udh with a sequence identity of 75.6 . Atu3143 and PP1171 were PCR amplified from their respective genomes and along with udh from were integrated into plasmid vector pTrc99SE to create plasmids pTATudh2 pTPPudh and pTPSudh respectively for comparison of relative activities of the expressed recombinant proteins. Transformed DH10B clones were cultivated in LB with or without 0.1 mM IPTG before preparing crude lysates to carry out enzymatic analysis . These assays confirmed a NAD consuming activity in the presence of glucuronate as a substrate for the recombinant proteins of and similar to that previously obtained with . The two udh genes from and were also deposited to Genbank as Accession Numbers BK006462 DNA SEQ ID NO 23 protein SEQ ID NO 24 and BK006380 DNA SEQ ID NO 25 protein SEQ ID NO 26 respectively.

Purification and Characterization of Recombinant Udh and Analysis of the Reaction Product Enzyme reactions using crude lysates containing the udh gene confirmed the presence of an activity that utilized glucuronate as a substrate with the reaction rate proportional to glucuronate concentration for low substrate loads data not shown . The activity also utilized NAD but not NADP as a co factor data not shown . These results indicated that the substrate was oxidized. An examination of the structure of glucuronate suggests two possible points of oxidation the conversion of an alcohol to a ketone or the conversion of the aldehyde to carboxylic acid the latter reaction producing glucarate. The difference in these two products should be evident from a mass spectrum as the former would result in a mass difference of 2 relative to the substrate while the latter would produce a mass difference of 16. To confirm the product of the enzyme reaction as glucarate a sample was analyzed by LC MS. The spectra of the eluent separated from the enzyme reaction and a glucarate standard are in agreement suggesting glucarate as the product of the Udh reaction .

Each of the three udh genes were expressed in with 6 His tags and purified to determine the kinetic parameters of the corresponding enzymes. Purified enzymes were analyzed by SDS PAGE to confirm molecular weight of the monomer and estimate purity . The Udh of and were both approximately 30 KDa molecular weight which is consistent both with the translation of the cloned gene and previous reports 38 . The Udh is slightly larger at 32 KDa. The purified preparations were used to determine the kinetic parameters kand K for each of the enzymes. Both glucuronate and galacturonate were used as substrates and NAD co factor concentration was also varied to determine the corresponding K Table 5 . Measurements of kobtained by varying co factor concentration were within 20 of the values obtained using glucuronate as the substrate data not shown . In all cases kwas higher for glucuronate than for galacturonate. The highest rate constant was found for the enzyme utilizing glucuronate as substrate k 1.9 10s which was more than 2 fold higher than the rate for the enzymes. However the Michaelis affinity constant was lower for galacturonate in all cases with the lowest K 0.04 mM found for the enzyme utilizing galacturonate as substrate. The first order rate constants k K are highest for galacturonate as substrate with the largest difference between glucuronate and galacturonate observed for

The responses of the enzyme activities to changes in pH and temperature were also investigated . A pH optimum of 8.0 was observed for both the and enzymes although the activity was relatively unchanged between pH 7 and pH 8 for Udh . This pH behavior is consistent with previous reports for Udh 3 . The enzyme exhibited highest activity at pH 7.0. In general enzyme activities varied approximately 10 between pH 5 and pH 8 with significant drops in activity observed for pH values greater than 8 for all three enzymes.

The impact of temperature was evaluated in two ways. First the thermal stability was examined by exposing enzyme preparations to various temperatures for 30 minutes then performing the enzyme assay under standard conditions. The Udh was found to exhibit a significantly higher thermal stability than either of the enzymes . The activity remained near 80 of maximum after exposure of the preparation to 37 C. while the corresponding activities for both of the other enzymes was below 20 of maximum. The stability profiles for both enzymes were similar to one another. Finally enzyme activity was evaluated for assays conducted under increasing temperatures. These activities followed a general trend of increasing activity with increasing temperature between 4 and 42 C. which is consistent with an Arrhenius type dependence of the catalytic rate constant on temperature .

For final characterization of the products of these reactions the boronic acid affinity gel was used to isolate the putative glucarate produced from all three enzymes in in vitro reactions using purified proteins. Samples of the three products were then subjected to circular dichroism CD analysis to examine the stereochemistry of the compounds. All three spectra were in agreement with a glucarate standard confirming the identity of the product as glucaric acid and the identity of the three genes as those encoding uronate dehydrogenases data not shown .

Uronate dehydrogenase Udh catalyzes the first step of an oxidation pathway for aldohexuronate catabolism in bacteria. In bacteria only limited studies of Udh in and have been reported. Moreover Udh has been even more rarely studied in eukaryotes. A Udh sequence was reported in the wine grape where it was identified as galacturonate reductase EC 1.1.1.203 BRENDA Accession Number A 1Y2Z0 GenBank Accession Number DQ843600 . We synthesized this gene with codon usage optimized for expression in DNA 2.0 Menlo Park Calif. and expressed the recombinant protein. However no activity related to Udh was observed when using either NAD or NADP as a cofactor data not shown . An alignment of this sequence with the Udh identified in the current work reveals only 10 identity between them. We can not rule out the possibility that the enzyme could not be functionally expressed in however based on the alignment we conclude that the reported sequence from is either not uronate dehydrogenase or it is a highly divergent version of the enzyme.

A shotgun library of was introduced into uxaC to screen for the udh gene encoding uronate dehydrogenase and PSPTO1053 and iolB gene were identified and screened as possible Udh candidates. By enzymatic analysis PSPTO1053 was ultimately identified to be the udh gene encoding uronate dehydrogenase. In a uxaC deletion mutant of where glucuronate catabolism is abolished glucuronate was converted to glucarate by uronate dehydrogenase then degraded to pyruvate or 2 phosphoglycerate from which it can be used as an energy source 27 33 . In uxaC introduction of the iolB gene allowed for growth on M9 agar containing glucuronate as a sole carbon source as well but this gene did not possess Udh activity. IolB has previously been reported as a protein related to myo inositol catabolism in and 41 42 . IolB belongs to the iol operon used for myo inositol degradation in and converts 5 deoxy glucuronate to 2 deoxy 5 keto D gluconate 42 . IolB of has about 48 homology with that of . The precise mechanism of glucuronate consumption in cells harboring IolB in our screen is unclear. Presumably this protein is able to convert glucuronate to an analogous compound that is compatible with metabolism.

The udh gene loci in the genomes of and are shown in . The udh loci of and are at about 1 150 and 1 346 kbp respectively while the udh locus in is at about 150 kbp. In the genes Atu3140 3141 3142 and 3145 adjacent to udh are kdgD kduD kdul and kdgF respectively and are related to pectin degradation. Pectin is a heteropolysaccharide consisting of 1 4 linked D galacturonate residues which is derived from plant cell walls. Pectin degradation and uptake by bacteria has been well researched in phytopathogenic Pectobacterium including and by Hugouvieux Cotte Pattat et al. 12 14 . In pectin is degraded by genes of the kdu or kdg operon to use as an energy source. In and the genes adjacent to udh are identified as TRAP Tripartite ATP independent periplasmic dicarboxylate transporters and porin. Among these genes the porin protein PSPTO1054 PP1173 is known to be related to uptake of oligogalacturonate derived from pectin degradation 34 . Uronate dehydrogenase in plant pathogenic bacteria might therefore function in the utilization of a hexuronate derived from host plant cell wall pectin which is subsequently converted to hexarate.

Alignment of the three uronate dehydrogenases from and and phylogenetic analysis of their homologs were performed . The sequences of the enzymes show two primary sequence motifs YxxxK and GxxGxxG related to conserved domains . The YxxxK motif is located between Tyrand Lysof Udh and is the primary motif of the 3 alpha beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase domain 11 37 . The GxxGxxG motif located in Glyof Udh is similar to Rossman folds GxxxG or GxGxxG which have been discovered in NAD binding domains 20 . In the phylogenetic analysis the uronate dehydrogenase shows homologies with NAD dependent epimerase dehydratase nucleotide sugar epimerase 3 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isomerase and short chain dehydrogenase reductase in archaea and bacteria including proteobacteria cyanobacteria green nonsulfur bacteria and gram positive bacteria as well as homology with nucleotide sugar epimerase in a few eukaryotes including fungi plants and human . The three uronate dehydrogenases screened in this study are present in alpha and gamma proteobacteria and their homologies are relatively close to the Archaea and and the fungus 

We have screened and sequenced three uronate dehydrogenases from and which can effectively convert glucuronate to glucarate. While this enzyme is important for the catabolism of uronic acids in several types of bacteria it may also be useful in the development of biosynthetic pathways for the production of aldaric acids such as glucaric acid. Glucarate is the end product of nucleotide sugar metabolism and is found naturally in mammals and plant 21 39 . Glucarate and its derivatives such as glucaro 1 4 lactone have been studied previously as detoxifying and natural anti carcinogenic compounds 8 21 36 39 as well as a building block for polymer synthesis 16 . It has also been designated as a potential top value added chemical to be produced from biomass 40 . Presently glucarate is synthesized from glucose by chemical oxidation using a strong oxidant such as nitric acid or nitric oxide 25 . We have used the udh of identified in this study to successfully produce glucaric acid from a synthetic pathway in 26 .
