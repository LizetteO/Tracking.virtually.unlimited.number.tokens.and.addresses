Histone deacetylases HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histones proteins that organize and modulate the structure of chromatin in nucleosomes. HDAC mediated deacetylation of chromatin bound histones regulates the expression of a variety of genes throughout the genome. Importantly HDACs have been linked to cancer as well as other health conditions. To date eleven major HDAC isoforms have been described HDACs 1 11 . HDACs are categorized into two classes. Class I HDACs include HDAC1 HDAC2 HDAC3 HDAC8 and HDAC11. Class II HDACs include HDAC4 HDAC5 HDAC6 HDAC7 HDAC9 and HDAC10. Small molecule HDAC inhibitors that are isoform selective are useful as therapeutic agents with reduced toxicity and as tools for probing the biology of the HDAC isoforms.

Covalent modification of histone proteins through acetylation and deacetylation is an important determinant of chromatin structure and a regulator of gene expression. Acetylation of histone proteins occurs on lysine residues near the N termini of these proteins. In conjunction with other modifications of histone proteins and DNA the acetylation state of histones determines whether the chromatin is in a condensed transcriptionally silent state or in a form more accessible to the transcription machinery of the cell. In general hyperacetylation of histone proteins is associated with transcriptional activation of genes. The steady state histone acetylation level arises from the opposing action of histone acetyltransferase HAT and histone deacetylase HDAC enzymes.

Histone deacetylases HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine amino groups near the N termini of histones. This reaction promotes the condensation of chromatin leading to repression of transcription.

HDAC inhibitors HDIs modify gene expression positively or negatively in a cell and gene specific manner. HDIs increase the accumulation of acetylated histones directly influencing chromatin structure and thereby the relationship of the nucleosome to gene promoter elements.

Histone deacetylase HDAC enzymes modulate gene expression through the deacetylation of acetylated lysine residues on histone proteins. They operate in biological systems as part of multiprotein corepressor complexes. Histone deacetylases have been grouped into three classes. Class I and class II histone deacetylases HDACs are zinc containing hydrolase enzymes. The division of the proteins into classes I and II is based on protein size sequence similarity and organization of the protein domains.

Members of class I are related to the yeast RPD3 gene product. Class I HDACs include HDAC1 HDAC2 HDAC3 HDAC8 HDAC11.

HDAC8 is a 377 residue 42 kDa protein localized to the nucleus of a wide array of tissues as well as several human tumor cell lines. The wild type form of full length HDAC8 is described in GenBank Accession Number NP 060956 Buggy J. J. et al. 350 Pt 1 199 205 2000 . The HDAC8 structure was solved with four different hydroxamate inhibitors bound Somoza et al. 2004 12 1325 

Class II HDACs have been further subdivided into classes IIa HDACs 4 5 7 and 9 and IIb HDACs 6 and 10 .

The third class of deacetylases consists of the members of the Sir2 family of enzymes. These enzymes have histone deacetylase activity but are structurally and evolutionarily unrelated to the class I and class II proteins. They are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD dependent and unlike class I HDACs and class II HDACs they do not contain a catalytic zinc site.

In the cell HDAC proteins are recruited as part of multicomponent repressor complexes. Several HDAC containing complexes have been characterized including the N CoR SMRT Sin3 NuRD and CoREST complexes. Within these complexes HDACs 1 and 2 typically interact with the mSin3 Mi 2 or CoREST proteins. HDAC3 and the class IIa HDACs have been shown to interact with SMRT and the related N CoR protein. A large number of transcription factors have been shown to bind to one of the corepressor complexes as a means of regulating transcription. The recruitment of HDACs by DNA binding proteins allows histone deacetylation to be directed toward specific regions of the chromatin in order to promote targeted transcriptional repression.

HDAC proteins are promising therapeutic targets on account of their involvement in regulating genes involved in cell cycle progression and control. Inhibition of HDACs has been shown to upregulate genes including p21WAF CIP1 p27 p53 and cyclin E and to down regulate genes such as cyclin A and cyclin D. Growth inhibition in several lines of cancer cells has been observed upon treatment with HDAC inhibitors and in vivo studies have shown that some of these inhibitors are efficacious in slowing tumor growth. The biological activity of each of the HDAC isozymes is determined by a combination of the intrinsic activity of the enzyme and the effects of cofactor binding on reactivity and substrate recognition Schultz et al. 2004 43 11083 11091 .

Non selective HDAC inhibitors inhibit the deacetylase activity of most if not all of the HDACs with equal potency. The mechanisms of the anticancer effects of SAHA a non selective HDAC inhibitor are not completely understood and likely result from both altered gene expression and altered function of proteins regulating cell proliferation and cell death pathways. Non selective HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA induce the accumulation of acetylated histone proteins and non histone proteins. Non histone proteins that are acetylated include but are not limited to

HDAC enzymes or isoforms appear to be involved in many different types of cancer. Inhibition of HDACs with HDAC inhibitors results in multiple and desirable anti cancer effects such as but not limited to i the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation ii the induction of apoptosis cell death of cancer cells iii cell cycle regulation iv the induction of tumour suppressor genes and v the blocking of tumour angiogenesis development of new tumour blood vessels . These multiple effects provided by HDAC inhibitors provide a method of treating cancer.

Interest in histone deacetylase enzymes HDACs as targets for pharmaceutical development has centered on the role of HDACs in regulating genes associated with cell cycle progression and the development and progression of cancer Kramer et. al. 12 294 300 2001 . Several studies have shown that treatment of various cell lines with HDAC inhibitors leads to hyper acetylation of histone proteins and cell cycle arrest in late Gphase or at the G M transition. Genes involved in the cell cycle that have been shown to be up regulated by HDAC inhibitors include p21 p27 p53 and cyclin E. Cyclin A and cyclin D have been reported to be down regulated by HDAC inhibitors. In tumor cell lines several studies have shown that treatment with HDAC inhibitors lead to growth inhibition growth arrest terminal differentiation and or apoptosis. In vivo studies have demonstrated growth inhibition of tumors and a reduction in tumor metastasis as a result of treatment with HDAC inhibitors.

The clearest link between abnormal HDAC activity and cancer occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemia. In this condition a chromosomal translocation leads to the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor RAR with the promyelocytic leukemia PML or promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger PLZF proteins. Both PML RAR and PLZF RAR promote the progression of leukemia by repressing retinoic acid regulated genes through the abnormal recruitment of SMRT mSin3 HDAC complex Lin et. al. 391 811 814 1998 Grignani et al. 391 815 818 1998 . Whereas the PML RAR form of the disease is treatable with retinoic acid the PLZF RAR form is resistant to this treatment. For a patient with the retinoic acid resistant form of the disease the addition of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate to the dosing regimen led to complete clinical and cytogenic remission Warren et al. 90 1621 1625 1998 . HDACs have also been associated with Huntington s disease Steffan et al. 413 739 744 Histone deacetylase inhibitors arrest polyglutamine dependent neurodegeneration in .

In general almost all of the inhibitors targeting HDACs are broad spectrum compounds inhibiting all of the HDAC isoforms with equal potency. These broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors cause the induction of differentiation growth arrest and or apoptosis in a large number of tumor cell lines in vitro.

Clinical administration of broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors pan HDAC inhibitors has been associated with many dose limiting toxicities. These include thrombocytopenia and other hematological toxicities QTc prolongation and other cardiac toxicities nausea fever fatigue and anorexia For example see 2003 9 10 3578 3588 2002 8 7 2142 2148 and 2005 46 Abs 3978 . Selective HDAC inhibitors that selectively inhibit only one HDAC isoform as opposed to a pan selective inhibitor is expected to produce a drug with an improved toxicity profile.

Adverse effects in humans have been reported in several clinical trials using pan HDAC inhibitors. Originally designed for oncological applications such toxicities might not be crucial when taking into consideration their therapeutic effects and the high mortality rate of cancer.

Described herein are selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds. Compounds described herein selectively inhibit HDAC8 over other HDAC isoforms e.g. HDACs 1 2 3 6 10 and 11 .

As described herein HDAC8 is expressed primarily in delta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas in small intestinal epithelial cells and in neuroendocrine cells. Of note delta cells express and secrete somatostatin a peptide hormone that inhibits the secretion of insulin and growth hormone. Without being bound by theory it is believed that HDAC8 activity drives the expression of somatostatin in delta cells. Thus inhibiting HDAC8 activity is expected to decrease somatostatin expression and secretion from delta cells and consequently increase systemic insulin and growth hormone levels.

Described herein are methods for inhibiting somatostatin expression in a subject by administering to the subject a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition. Further described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from an insulin deficiency or a growth hormone deficiency by administering a selective HDAC8 inhibitor to the subject.

HDAC8 is expressed at unusually high levels in tumor cell lines e.g. Jurkat HuT78 K562 PC3 and OVCR 3. In fact as described herein inhibiting HDAC8 activity decreases proliferation of T cell derived tumor cells e.g. Jurkat cells by apoptosis. In contrast HDAC8 inhibition does not affect the proliferation of either non cancerous cells e.g. peripheral blood mononuclear cells or tumor cell lines other than T cell derived lines. Thus selective HDAC8 inhibitors are useful for slowing or arresting the progression of T cell derived cancers with lessened or no toxicity to non cancerous cells.

Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein were screened against tumor cell lines in vitro and were found to induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from T cell lymphomas or leukemias. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein inhibit the growth and induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Unlike broad spectrum inhibitors selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein do not cause detectable histone or tubulin acetylation but lead to a dose dependent decrease in HDAC8 protein levels in treated cells. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein activated caspases 3 8 and 9 showing that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptic pathways were involved accordingly apoptosis was blocked completely by pan caspase inhibitors but only partially by inhibitors of specific caspases. Thus selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein are of benefit in the treatment of T cell lymphomas and leukemias.

Described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from a T cell lymphoma by administering to the subject a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition. Also described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from a T cell lymphoma by administering to the subject a population of autologous T cells that have been exposed to a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition ex vivo.

In some embodiments selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds and compositions thereof are used to treat a subject suffering from a T cell lymphoma e.g. a peripheral T cell lymphoma a lymphoblastic lymphoma a cutaneous T cell lymphoma or an adult T cell lymphoma.

In some embodiments the T cell lymphoma treatment method includes administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor pharmaceutical composition.

In other embodiments the T cell lymphoma treatment includes administering in addition to a selective HDAC8 inhibitor pharmaceutical composition one or more additional anti cancer agents described herein in any combination.

The methods described herein include administering a pharmaceutical composition containing a selective HDAC8 inhibitor in a quantity sufficient to decrease HDAC8 deacetylase activity in vivo by a therapeutically effective amount. In some embodiments cells derived from a subject to be treated i.e. autologous cells are exposed ex vivo to a pharmaceutical composition containing a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition in a quantity sufficient to decrease HDAC8 deacetylase activity in vitro.

In one embodiment T cells from a donor subject suffering a T cell lymphoma are cultured and expanded ex vivo in the presence of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor at a concentration that is effective for selectively killing transformed T cells. Afterwards the expanded T cell population free of transformed T cells are introduced into the donor subject. T cell culture in vitro expansion and in vivo transfer is described in e.g. Porter et al. 2006 107 4 1325 1331 Rapoport et al. 2005 1230 1237 Laport et al. 2003 102 6 2004 2013.

In some embodiments a subject is administered a therapeutically effective amount of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor to decrease secretion of one or more inflammatory cytokines e.g. IL 1 .

In some embodiments a selective HDAC8 inhibitor compound is administered to a subject to decrease the systemic levels of one or more inflammatory cytokines including e.g. IL 1 IL 6 IL 18 TNF MCP 1 or MIP 1a.

As described herein selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein reduce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including but not limited to interleukin 1 beta IL 1 . Thus HDAC8 is the HDAC enzyme involved in cytokine secretion. The use of selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds provides a method of reducing cytokine secretion with reduced toxicity due to the selective inhibition of one HDAC isoform vs. the use of pan HDAC inhibitors that inhibit all of the HDAC isoforms .

Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein inhibit in a dose dependent fashion lipopolysaccharide LPS and or ATP stimulated secretion of IL 1 from purified human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs as well as from the monocyte cell line THP 1. In some embodiments the ECfor inhibition ranges from about 0.5 micromolar to about 5 micromolar.

The production and secretion of IL 1 is via a non classical pathway of protein secretion involving potassium efflux the autocatalytic processing of procaspase 1 the cleavage by active caspase 1 of the IL 1 precursor the influx of calcium ions and the activation of specific phospholipases including PLA 2. In some embodiments selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein inhibit one or more steps in this secretory pathway.

As described herein selective HDAC8 inhibitors are used to treat diseases or conditions that are mediated or linked to IL secretion and activity.

Chronic inflammation in patients has been linked to cancer development Coussens et al. 420 860 867 2002 . Cancers associated with chronic inflammation include but are not limited to lung esophageal gastric pancreatic cervical bladder prostate and colorectal cancers. The role of the inflammatory microenvironment as a causative factor in the etiology of cancer is also supported by findings that regular use of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs is associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal breast and gastric cancer. Pro inflammatory cytokines are mediators of chronic inflammatory responses and have effects on malignant processes.

Pro inflammatory cytokines are involved in carcinogenesis and malignant transformation tumor growth invasion and metastasis. Persistent expression of proinflammatory cytokines in or near tumors exerts a range of effects including but not limited to increasing growth and invasiveness of the malignant cells metastsis tumorigenesis to activation of immune mediated mechanisms leading to the destruction of tumor cells and inhibition of tumor growth. IL 1 transfected tumor cells have been reported to fail to induce effective antitumor immune responses. In several human cancers local IL 1 expression by the malignant cells or the microenvironment has been associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis.

In IL 1 transfected fibrosarcoma cells an up regulation of MMP 2 and MMP 9 and TGF genes that are involved in invasiveness was observed as opposed to the shut off of these genes in IL 1 transfected fibrosarcomas cells. IL 1 is thought to also enhance the invasiveness of already existing tumor cells by switching on angiogenesis and by the induction of inflammatory molecules such as MMPs heparanase chemokines or integrins on the malignant cells or endothelial cells leading to tumor dissemination and metastasis. IL 1 induces secretion of growth and invasiveness promoting factors e.g. matrix metalloproteinases and angiogenic factors i.e. VEGF and bFGF and ELR positive CXC chemokines i.e. IL 8 and MCP 1 . Apte et al. seminars in vol. 12 2002 277 290 .

Secreted IL 1 has been implicated in tumor growth and invasion. Inhibition of IL 1 secretion e.g. by using selective HDAC8 compounds in malignant cells or in the tumor s microenvironment provides a method for cancer therapy.

Throughout the specification groups and substituents thereof are chosen to provide stable moieties and compounds.

In some embodiments compounds described herein possess one or more stereocenters and each center exists in the R or S configuration. The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric enantiomeric and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. In some embodiments separation of stereoisomers are performed by chromatography. In other embodiments individual stereoisomers are obtained by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. In one embodiment the resolution of enantiomers are carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds described herein dissociable complexes are also possible e.g. crystalline diastereomeric salts . Diastereomers have distinct physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points solubilities reactivity etc. and are readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. In some embodiments the diastereomers are separated by chiral chromatography or by separation resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer s is are then recovered along with the resolving agent by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture is found in Jean Jacques Andre Collet Samuel H. Wilen Enantiomers Racemates and Resolutions John Wiley And Sons Inc. 1981 herein incorporated by reference for such disclosure. In further embodiments stereoisomers are obtained by stereoselective synthesis.

In some situations compounds exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the formulas described herein.

The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N oxides crystalline forms also known as polymorphs or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds described herein as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity. In some situations compounds exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented herein. In addition the compounds described herein exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water ethanol and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.

In some embodiments the compounds described herein in unoxidized form are prepared from the corresponding N oxides compounds by treating with a reducing agent such as but not limited to sulfur sulfur dioxide triphenyl phosphine lithium borohydride sodium borohydride phosphorus trichloride phosphorus tribromide or the like in a suitable inert organic solvent such as but not limited to acetonitrile ethanol aqueous dioxane or the like at 0 to 80 C.

In some embodiments compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A prodrug refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because in some situations they are easier to administer than the parent drug. In some embodiments prodrugs are bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. In other embodiments the prodrug has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example without limitation of a prodrug would be a compound described herein which is administered as an ester the prodrug to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid the active entity once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug is a short peptide polyaminoacid bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments upon in vivo administration a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound.

To produce a prodrug a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. In some embodiments the prodrug is designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug to mask side effects or toxicity to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. In some embodiments once a pharmaceutically active compound is known knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo aids in the design of prodrugs of the compound. see for example Nogrady 1985 Oxford University Press New York pages 388 392 Silverman 1992 The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action Academic Press Inc. San Diego pages 352 401 Saulnier et al. 1994 Vol. 4 p. 1985 Rooseboom et al. 56 53 102 2004 Miller et al. . Vol. 46 no. 24 5097 5116 2003 Aesop Cho Recent Advances in Oral Prodrug Discovery Vol. 41 395 407 2006 .

Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some embodiments some of the herein described compounds are a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.

In some embodiments prodrugs are easier to administer than the parent drug. In some embodiments the prodrug is bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. In other embodiments the prodrug has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. In further embodiments prodrugs are designed as reversible drug derivatives for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site specific tissues. In some embodiments the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See e.g. Fedorak et al. 269 G210 218 1995 McLoed et al. 106 405 413 1994 Hochhaus et al. 6 283 286 1992 J. Larsen and H. Bundgaard 37 87 1987 J. Larsen et al. 47 103 1988 Sinkula et al. 64 181 210 1975 T. Higuchi and V. Stella Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series and Edward B.

In certain instances it is appropriate to administer at least one compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein such as a hydroxamic acid compound described herein is nausea then it is appropriate to administer an anti nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or by way of example only the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant i.e. by itself the adjuvant has minimal therapeutic benefit but in combination with another therapeutic agent the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced . Or by way of example only the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent which also includes a therapeutic regimen that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case regardless of the disease disorder or condition being treated the overall benefit experienced by the patient is additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient experiences a synergistic benefit.

The particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds are administered concurrently e.g. simultaneously essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol or sequentially depending upon the nature of the disease disorder or condition the condition of the patient and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol is determined after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.

For combination therapies described herein dosages of the co administered compounds will vary depending on the type of co drug employed on the specific drug employed on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition when co administered with one or more biologically active agents the compound provided herein is administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent s or sequentially. If administered sequentially the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent s .

In any case the multiple therapeutic agents one of which is a HDAC8 selective compound described herein are administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously the multiple therapeutic agents are provided in a single unified form or in multiple forms by way of example only either as a single pill or as two separate pills . In some embodiments the therapeutic agents are given in multiple doses or both are given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous the timing between the multiple doses varies from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition the combination methods compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned.

It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat prevent or ameliorate the condition s for which relief is sought is modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder or condition from which the subject suffers as well as the age weight sex diet and medical condition of the subject. Thus the dosage regimen actually employed varies widely and therefore deviates from the dosage regimens set forth herein.

The pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein are a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy are administered sequentially with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two step administration. The two step administration regimen calls for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps ranges from a few minutes to several hours depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent such as potency solubility bioavailability plasma half life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration also determines the optimal dose interval.

In addition the compounds described herein are used in combination with procedures that provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only patients are expected to find therapeutic and or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound disclosed herein and or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions.

The compounds described herein and combination therapies are administered before during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound varies. Thus for example the compounds are used as a prophylactic and are administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions are administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds are initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms in other embodiments within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms in further embodiments within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms and in yet further embodiments within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration is via any route practical such as for example an intravenous injection a bolus injection infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours a pill a capsule transdermal patch buccal delivery and the like or combination thereof. In some embodiments a compound is administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease such as for example from about 1 month to about 3 months. The length of treatment varies for each subject and the length is determined using the known criteria. For example the compound or a formulation containing the compound is administered for at least 2 weeks in some embodiments about 1 month to about 5 years and in other embodiments from about 1 month to about 3 years.
