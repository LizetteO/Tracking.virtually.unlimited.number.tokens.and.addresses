title: System and method for location based exchanges of data facilitating distributed location applications
abstract: Provided is a distributed system and method for enabling new and useful location dependent features and functionality to mobile data processing systems. Mobile data processing systems (MSs) interact with each other as peers in communications and interoperability. Indirectly located mobile data processing systems are located relative other mobile data processing systems, and are automatically located using whereabouts data of directly located mobile data processing systems and/or whereabouts data of other indirectly located mobile data processing systems. A mobile data processing system may dynamically take on roles of being directly located or indirectly located, depending on the environment and capabilities available at a particular time. Data is shared between mobile data processing systems to carry out novel Location Based eXchanges (LBX) of data for new mobile applications. Information transmitted inbound to, transmitted outbound from, is in process at, or is application modified at a mobile data processing system triggers processing of actions in accordance with user configured permissions, charters, and other configurations. In a preferred embodiment, a user configurable platform is provided for quickly building well behaving LBX applications at MSs and across a plurality of interoperating MSs. Tools, triggered interfaces and integrated applications are disclosed for a breadth of MS LBX configurations and functionality.
