This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT US2007 083799 filed Nov. 6 2007 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 864 782 filed Nov. 7 2006 both of which are incorporated in this application by reference.

This disclosure was made with support under grant numbers EEC 0118007 and EEC 0647452 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.

The present disclosure according to certain embodiments generally relates to particle separation. More specifically the present disclosure according to certain embodiments relates to methods for separating magnetic nanoparticles.

The removal of particles from solution with magnetic fields may be among other things more selective and efficient and often much faster than traditional centrifugation or filtration techniques. As a result magnetic separations may be used in fields including but not limited to biotechnology and ore refinement. In many cases the process utilizes the generation of magnetic forces on particles large enough to overcome opposing forces such as Brownian motion viscous drag and sedimentation. In biotechnology for example magnetic separators may use relatively low field gradients in a batch mode to concentrate surface engineered magnetic beads from a suspension. For manufacturing magnetic materials may be recovered from waste streams under flow conditions with high gradient magnetic separators HGMS that use larger fields up to 2 Tesla and columns filled with ferromagnetic materials.

Decreasing the particle sizes used in magnetic separations from microns to nanometers may increase the available sorptive areas by at least about hundred times. Such material optimization however is not generally practical because the magnetic force acting on a particle in a field gradient is proportion to the particle volume. If particles are too small their magnetic tractive forces in a field gradient may not be large enough to overcome Brownian motion and little or no separation may occur. For iron oxide extrapolations from the behavior of the bulk material suggest that the critical size for separation is about 50 nm for the case of an isolated non aggregated particle. This treatment assumes very large applied fields and the latest designs for extremely high gradient separators both features that may make magnetic separations prohibitively expensive in many settings. For simpler and less costly low gradient separators the critical size for capture in magnetic gradients may increase substantially.

Extrapolations from bulk properties to nanoscale materials are frequently problematic and a more comprehensive analysis of nanoscale magnetic behavior suggests that nanocrystals NCs could offer a significant opportunity for low field magnetic separations. Below about 50 nm diameter nanoscale magnets may exhibit a complex range of size dependent behaviors including but not limited to a transition below about 40 nm in size to single domain character magnetic susceptibilities greater than that of the bulk material and the emergence of superparamagnetic behavior. Such systems may experience larger magnetic forces than expected from bulk behavior due to larger moments. Advantages of higher susceptibility materials such as FeCo have been suggested in which an increased magnetic moment could in principle enable high gradient separations with isolated nanocrystals. Additionally in external fields the large surface gradients present at the surfaces of single domain materials may induce transient aggregation effectively forming larger and more magnetically responsive particles. Nanoparticle aggregation even before field application has been posited to explain the observation of the magnetic capture of polydisperse nanocrystals in a high gradient separation 1000 T m using fields of 1 to 2 Tesla.

As used herein the term nanoparticle refers to a particle or crystal having a diameter of between about 1 and 1000 nm. Similarly the term nanoparticles refers to a plurality of particles having an average diameter of between about 1 and 1000 nm.

Any magnetic nanoparticle suitable for use in a desired application may be used in the methods of the present disclosure. The magnetic particle may be formed at least in part from any material affected by a magnetic field. Examples of suitable materials include but are not limited to magnetite maghemite hematite ferrites and materials comprising one or more of iron cobalt manganese nickel chromium gadolinium neodymium dysprosium samarium erbium iron carbide iron nitride. In certain embodiments the magnetic particles may have a size in the range of from about 1 nm to about 500 nm in diameter and may form clusters of larger sizes. One specific example of a suitable magnetic particle is an iron oxide FeO nanocrystal.

The magnetic nanoparticles may be synthesized using methods known in the art. The methods of the present invention are particularly suited for use with samples of polydisperse magnetic nanoparticles but may be advantageously applied to monodisperse samples as well.

In some embodiments the magnetic nanoparticle may be at least partially coated with a surface coating. The surface coating may be any coating suitable for use in a desired application. For example the magnetic nanoparticle may be functionalized for example with biotin avidin to promote the attachment of biological ligands such as antibodies or fragments thereof. A variety of ligands such as antibodies or derivatives thereof receptor molecules opsonins and the like may be attached to the surface of the magnetic nanoparticle. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of the present disclosure may recognize additional suitable surface coatings. Such surface coatings are still considered to be within the spirit of the present disclosure.

The magnetic separator may be any device capable of applying a magnetic field to a plurality of magnetic nanoparticles for subsequent collection. Magnetic separators are well known in the art. One form of suitable magnetic separation device functions by magnetizable particle entrapment and is generally referred to as a High Gradient Magnetic Separator or HGMS. HGMS are particularly suited to colloidal magnetic materials that are not readily separable from solution as such even with powerful electro magnets but instead require high gradient field separation techniques. One example of a commercially available HGMS is the MACS device made by Miltenyi Biotec GmbH Gladbach West Germany which employs a column filled with a non rigid steel wool matrix in cooperation with a permanent magnet.

The magnetic separator used in the methods of the present disclosure may depend on among other things the nature and particle size of the magnetic particle. Micron size ferromagnetic particles may be readily removed from solution by means of commercially available magnetic separation devices. In many cases these devices employ a single relatively inexpensive permanent magnet located external to a container holding the test medium. Examples of such magnetic separators are the MAIA Magnetic Separator manufactured by Serono Diagnostics Norwell Mass. the DYNAL MPC 1 manufactured by DYNAL Inc. Great Neck N.Y. and the BioMag Separator manufactured by Advanced Magnetics Inc. Cambridge Mass. A specific application of a device of this type in performing magnetic solid phase radioimmunoassay is described in L. Hersh et al. Clinica Chemica Acta 63 69 72 1975 . A similar magnetic separator manufactured by Ciba Corning Medical Diagnostics Wampole Mass. is provided with rows of bar magnets arranged in parallel and located at the base of the separator. This device accommodates 60 test tubes with the closed end of each tube fitting into a recess between two of the bar magnets.

In some embodiments in order to separate magnetic particles of a desired size range the magnetic field in the magnetic separator is alternated. This may be advantageously used to narrow the size distribution of magnetic nanoparticles. Such alternation of the magnetic field may allow separation of magnetic nanoparticles into narrower size distributions that are substantially free of unwanted nonmagnetic material.

In one example of a method of the present disclosure a sample of wide size distributed magnetic nanoparticle dispersion may be passed through a magnetic separator e.g. HGMS at a specific magnetic field strength corresponding to the size of the smallest nanoparticle size desired. At least a portion of the nanoparticles smaller than those desired may pass through the magnetic separator and at least a portion of the nanoparticles within and larger than the narrowed size distribution may be retained in the magnetic separator. The magnetic field within the magnetic separator may then be decreased corresponding to the size of the largest nanoparticle size desired. The separated nanoparticles may then be recovered from the magnetic separator. Such a recovery may comprise passing a solvent through the magnetic separator. Such a method may be suitable for large scale production of magnetic nanoparticles e.g. iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles that may initially be produced with a wide size distribution. Accordingly this method may be used to separate fractions of narrow size distribution from a large scale production to make uniform nanoparticle batches from a non uniform set.

The methods of the present disclosure may benefit from among other things the size dependence of magnetic particle capture which may make it possible to develop magnetic separation processes that can in one process remove several different types of materials. Such capability is particularly important in biotechnology where the simultaneous treatment of mixtures may require more sophisticated multiplexed separations. demonstrates the principle for magnetic separations in which different field strengths recovered different populations of a bimodal distribution of iron oxide NCs. Initially the sample consists of two monodisperse fractions of nanocrystals intentionally combined to create a test solution at low applied fields 0.3 Tesla the effluent from the column contains 90 the smaller size and the larger size is retained . After the field is turned off a column wash recovered the larger fraction . Using monodisperse iron oxide nanocrystals it is thus possible to use magnetic separations in a multiplexed mode and recover different components of a mixture in one treatment.

In another embodiment magnetic particles are separated from non magnetic material using very low magnetic field gradients 

In some embodiments the methods of the present invention may be used to separate arsenic from a solution for example waste water. In operation arsenic may be sorbed onto a magnetic particle surface and removed from the solution by magnetic separation.

The methods of the present disclosure generally may be applied to any application involving magnetic separation. For example magnetic separators and methods of separation of magnetic particles from non magnetic media have been described for use in a variety of laboratory and clinical procedures involving biospecific affinity reactions. Such reactions are commonly employed in testing biological samples including but not limited to bodily fluids such as blood bone marrow leukapheresis products spinal fluid or urine for the determination of a wide range of target substances especially biological entities such as cells proteins nucleic acid sequences and the like.

To facilitate a better understanding of the present invention the following examples of specific embodiments are given. In no way should the following examples be read to limit or define the entire scope of the invention.

We now show that magnetite particles FeO of a critical size 20 nm can be removed from solution at very low field gradients 

Nanocrystalline FeOcould be removed from solution with a low gradient separator 23 T m similar to those applied to recovery of micrometer sized beads in protein purification. The initial rust colored solution contains FeONCs of 16 nm diameter homogeneously dispersed in water . Once placed in the separator the solution became clear within minutes and a deposit of particles formed at the back of the vial where the field gradient is the largest . After removal from the separator the solution can be restored to its initial state with a vigorous shake. Similar behavior is observed for all NCs larger than 10 nm but the time for complete separation varies with solution concentration and NC size.

By way of explanation and not of limitation the removal of nanocrystals cannot be explained with a simple model of non interacting particles. If we assume that the iron oxide particles act independently we may calculate a size cut off below which NCs will not be removed. For a 23 T m field gradient B the largest magnetic force that can be applied to a single particle of diameter d is

We characterized the size dependence of the nanocrystal separation process using a high gradient magnetic separator. Unlike the simple batch separator used in this system uses an electromagnet to generate external fields of variable strength around a column packed with ferromagnetic wire. Exact measures of the field gradients in such a system are challenging but most treatments predict that the gradient and applied external field are proportional and that at fields in excess of 1 T gradients of 10T m are possible. FeONCs of varying sizes were gravity fed into the 22.3 cm long column at various field strengths and the effluent collected and analyzed for iron content using atomic emission spectroscopy. From such experiments we calculated the fraction of material retained in the column at increasing magnetic field strengths and compare these retention efficiencies between samples .

The size dependence of the retention of NCs in the magnetized column is shown in . The amount of material retained in the column increases as the external field strength increases. For example nearly 100 of the 12 nm diameter nanocrystals are retained in the column at applied fields of only 0.2 Tesla well below the saturation magnetization for stainless steel. This same field however cannot capture nanocrystals less than 8.0 nm in diameter. shows that for all particles as the domain size becomes smaller more field is required to ensure their complete separation. This result parallels the observation that at low field strengths small nanocrystals are not fully magnetized. Without complete magnetization the magnetic moments of nanocrystals would be quite small and would not generate enough tractive force with external field gradients.

The size of nanocrystals can also influence their recovery after magnetic capture. As seen in at zero external field after columns are magnetized nanocrystals larger than 16 nm diameter cannot be removed from the column matrix even after repeated washes. This irreversible interaction is analogous to the fouling of a physical filter and would limit the use of larger magnetic sorbents in a commercial setting. Smaller nanocrystals however do not show such behavior and can be concentrated and reused quite easily . This observation stems from the fact that below about 16 nm diameter iron oxide nanocrystals behave as superparamagnets. In this limit NCs have no remanent magnetism and thus experience no interactions with the very small stray fields present in the ferromagnetic column matrix. This result is consistent with observations of commercial magnetic beads which found that even in micron sized systems there was much value to using magnetic materials that were superparamagnetic. The data shown here reveals that superparamagnetism is only one of several properties that should be considered in material design. Indeed if NCs are too small then magnetic separations require very large critical field strengths to affect any capture of particles . For optimal nanocrystal magnetic separations at low fields one should use the largest nanocrystals which still show superparamagnetic properties.

The size dependence of NC capture shown in now makes it possible to develop magnetic separation processes that can in one process remove several different types of materials. Such capability is particularly important in biotechnology where the simultaneous treatment of mixtures requires more sophisticated multiplexed separations. demonstrates the principle for magnetic separations in which different field strengths recovered different populations of a bimodal distribution of iron oxide NCs. Initially the sample consists of two monodisperse fractions of nanocrystals intentionally combined to create a test solution at low applied fields 0.3 Tesla the effluent from the column contains 90 the smaller size and the larger size is retained . After the field is turned off a column wash recovered the larger fraction . Using monodisperse iron oxide nanocrystals it is thus possible to use magnetic separations in a multiplexed mode and recover different components of a mixture in one treatment.

Since NCs can be removed from batch solutions using permanent handheld magnets we explored whether these NCs could act as effective magnetic sorbents for the removal of arsenic from water. Arsenic is a good model contaminant for these materials as its interaction with iron oxides is strong and irreversible even on the nanoscale particles and its practical and effective removal from groundwater remains an important and intractable problem in water treatment. Conventional high gradient magnetic separators operating at 1 Tesla and higher already find use in water treatment processes primarily to induce aggregation of intrinsically magnetic waste products not easily amenable to other methods of coagulation .

Both As III and As V exhibit strong adsorption onto iron oxide nanocrystalline surfaces as the concentration of arsenic increased in the standard solution the amount of As bound to NCs increased as well until the capacity of the material was reached . The interactions between iron oxide and arsenic are also irreversible so FeONCs that have bound As should not release the material back into the environment during storage and further treatment. These data show clearly that as the size of sorbent NCs decreases sorption capacities increase substantially because of the increased surface areas in the samples.

Once arsenic was sorbed onto NC surfaces magnetic separations provided a way to remove the materials from solution. The As concentrations in test solutions before and after removal of particles using a column magnetic separator Table 1 and Table 2 show that As III and As V can be reduced to well below the current U.S. standards for drinking water. Table 2 shows the Freundlich isotherms are curve fitted parameters with adsorption data at 0 500 g L aqueous concentration using the Freundlich equation q K C and the correlation coefficients of the adsorption data to the Freundlich equation are listed in Column . Also because the test NCs are very small 12 nm their very high specific surface areas provide extremely concentrated waste materials. For example 300 nm iron oxide particles have a sorption capacity of only 0.002 w w and thus to treat 50 L of 500 g L arsenic generates 1.4 kg of waste in contrast for an equivalent treatment only 15 grams of 12 nm iron oxide sorbent is required.

Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value however inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.

Therefore the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein. While numerous changes may be made by those skilled in the art such changes are encompassed within the spirit of this invention as illustrated in part by the appended claims.
