This application claims priority to and benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 034 401 filed on Mar. 6 2008.

U.S. patent Nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 11 966 504 is commonly owned and discloses related subject matter.

The skin is made up of three layers including the epidermis dermis and subcutaneous or fat layer. The epidermis of the skin is the outer layer and is a continuously renewing tissue. The majority of cells in the epidermis are keratinocytes that originate in the basal layer. The keratinocytes migrate from the basal layer to the outermost layer known as the stratum corneum.

The epidermis provides a protective barrier against transcutaneous water loss. The epidermis also prevents most bacteria viruses and other foreign substances from entering the body. The epidermis also protects the internal body from trauma.

The dermis is a layer of fibrous and elastic tissue that provides the skin flexibility and strength. The underlying fat layer provides insulation from heat and cold. The fat layer also provides an energy depot.

When skin ages the epidermal and dermal layers atrophy. It has been reported in studies that aged skin is characterized by a thinning epidermis. Gambichler et al. 2006 44 145 152 . It has also been reported that the epidermal turnover rate slows with aging. Baumann 2007 211 241 251 . As a result a protracted rate of stratum corneum replacement occurs. Moreover epidermal atrophy and slower wound healing can also occur. Often less effective desquamation is also prevalent. Such decelerated cell turnover can cause the skin surface to appear rough and dull in appearance. In sum as skin ages it becomes dry wrinkled and fragile and a loss of skin barrier function results.

Photoaging superimposes the effect of chronic ultraviolet induced UV induced damage in addition to normal intrinsic skin aging which leads to further changes in the skin. It has been reported that epidermal atrophy may occur in some individuals. Yaar et al. 2007 157 874 887 .

In addition to skin aging treatment using glucocorticoid hormones may inhibit keratinocyte proliferation. However chronic glucocorticoid hormone treatment is accompanied by side effects including reduced epidermal thickness decreased number of keratinocytes and loss of skin barrier function. Chebotaev et al. 2007 127 2749 2758 .

The instant invention provides therapeutic active pharmaceutical ingredients formulations thereof dosage forms thereof and method of use thereof to increase epidermal thickness in a mammal preferably a human. By increasing epidermal thickness several therapeutic benefits are realized such as skin barrier function a reduction in wrinkling improved wound healing restoration of the epidermis upon glucocorticoid induced skin atrophy and skin atrophy due to declining hormone e.g. estrogen and testosterone levels and or age and thinning of the skin due to disease.

The active hormonal form of vitamin D 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 1 25 OH D is known to affect cellular proliferation and differentiation. 1 25 OH Dalso has immunomodulatory activity.

1 25 OH Dacts by binding to a member of the nuclear receptor super family being the vitamin D receptor VDR . The VDR is a ligand activated transcription factor that in conjunction with the retinoid X receptor regulates the transcription of 1 25 OH Dtarget genes. Skin cells including keratinocytes fibroblasts and a number of cells in the immune system that are also present in skin express VDR.

The vitamin D hormone and analogs have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in skin diseases involving defective keratinocyte differentiation such as psoriasis. 1 25 OH Dhas been reported to inhibit the proliferation of keratinocytes in culture. Hosomi et al. 1983113 1950 1957 . 1 25 OH Dmay also be effective in treating keratinocyte hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation in psoriatic patients. Topical administration of 1 25 OH Dto the skin of the hairless C3H mouse has also been reported to induce epidermal proliferation and to increase epidermal thickness. Gniadecki et al. 199549 621 624 .

Solutes of the instant vitamin D analog compounds may be made using a pharmaceutically suitable solvent such as propylene glycol and or ethanol.

The pharmaceutically suitable topical carrier systems also referred to as drug delivery systems which are modern technology distributed with or as a part of a drug product that allows for the uniform release or targeting of drugs to the body preferably include FDA approved and or USP approved inactive ingredients. Under 21 CFR 210.3 b 8 an inactive ingredient is any component of a drug product other than the active ingredient. According to 21 CFR 210.3 b 7 an active ingredient is any component of a drug product intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans or other animals. Active ingredients include those components of the product that may undergo chemical change during the manufacture of the drug product and be present in the drug product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect. As used herein a kit also referred to as a dosage form is a packaged collection of related material.

As used herein the topical dosage form includes various dosage forms known in the art such as lotions an emulsion liquid dosage form whereby this dosage form is generally for external application to the skin lotion augmented a lotion dosage form that enhances drug delivery whereby augmentation does not refer to the strength of the drug in the dosage form gels a semisolid dosage form that contains a gelling agent to provide stiffness to a solution or a colloidal dispersion whereby the gel may contain suspended particles ointments a semisolid dosage form usually containing 50 hydrocarbons waxes or polyols as the vehicle whereby this dosage form is generally for external application to the skin or mucous membranes ointment augmented an ointment dosage form that enhances drug delivery whereby augmentation does not refer to the strength of the drug in the dosage form creams an emulsion semisolid dosage form usually containing 20 water and volatiles and or

Table 1 demonstrates the effect of 1 25 OH Dand various vitamin D analogs on epidermal thickness by summarizing increased epidermal thickness as a percentage of vehicle only treated skin.

The predictive dosing ranges set forth in Table 2 were calculated with the following assumption. For the high end of the oral dose range the highest dose given to the Rhino mouse has been corrected for the expected lesser sensitivity of a human and the dose has been further increased by 0.5 log dose. The low dose is 1 10lower than the high dose. Regarding the high end topical dose the value has been further multiplied by a factor of 20 because humans absorb only about 5 of the API as compared to 100 in mice allowing for higher exposure in the human before toxicity would be anticipated to occur. Differences in animal species skin sensitivity and relative skin absorption concerning various vitamin D analogs may also significantly affect the predictive efficacious dose in humans.

Methods. Animals and dose administration. Rhino mice 6 8 weeks old were dosed daily via the topical route. The mice were weighed three times per week. Doses of API were adjusted weekly based on body weight. The topical formulations dosage forms were made by mixing the API with two different topical carriers. One topical carrier consisted of 70 vol propylene glycol and 30 vol ethanol. The other topical carrier consisted of 30 vol propylene glycol and 70 vol ethanol. The topical vehicle control for a given comparative example was the vehicle carrier used in the API formulated topical dosage form. Animals were euthanized 72 hours after administration of the final topical dose and dorsal skin was collected for histological analysis.

Measurement of epidermal thickness. The extent of the efficacious increase in epidermal thickness was assessed by measuring the thickness i.e. depth of the epidermal layer of the skin. The degree of increase in epidermal thickness as compared to the increase in epidermal thickness in carrier vehicle only treated skin was indicative of the degree of efficacy.

Epidermal thickness was determined by histological analysis of tissue sections. Skin was fixed overnight in 4 paraformaldehyde at 4 C. with gentle agitation. The skin was dehydrated the following day in 100 methanol. Samples were embedded in paraffin. Nine sections each measuring 10 m and each separated by 150 m were taken from each mouse and stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain. Five of the nine sections were digitally imaged 6 magnification for analysis of the epidermal thickness using Metamorph Imaging Software single line function .

The thickness of the epidermis adjacent to each comedone open or healed on each respective image of the five sections was also then measured using a Wacom Intuos 3 Graphics Tablet interfaced with the software. The average width was determined for each Rhino mouse from multiple measurements. Individual epidermal thickness average was determined from a composite of measurements taken from all 5 images. Such average for each mouse was used to calculate the treatment group mean. Results in the figures are expressed in terms of mean standard error of the mean.

Preparation of topical formulations and dosage forms containing the various API s including 2MBis P CAGE 3 24R 2MD VitIII 17 20E NEL VD 03 2MPregna 2MP 20R 2MBisP 2MTrisP FF 44 FF 55 HPBS and 13Me2. Separate concentrated ethanolic stock solutions of each API were diluted to a predetermined dose concentration using a topical carrier vehicle. Two different carrier vehicles were used. One topical carrier consisted of 70 vol propylene glycol and 30 vol ethanol. The other topical carrier consisted of 30 vol propylene glycol and 70 vol ethanol. The vehicle was thoroughly mixed with the API. The topical dosing formulation and dosage form delivered a predetermined amount of API on a per kilogram body weight basis.

A 100 L dose was administered to the back of the mouse. An average weight of 24 30 g mouse was assumed initially in the dose volume calculations. Dosing volumes were adjusted weekly to deliver the predetermined desired dose amount of API based on the body weight of each animal.
