This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 119 207 filed Dec. 2 2008 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This application also claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to French Patent Application No. FR 0857939 filed Nov. 24 2008 the contents of which are also incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates to a composition for making up the skin for example the face or the lips comprising at least one polyalkene based supramolecular polymer. The disclosure also relates to a method for making up the skin and or lips comprising the application of such a composition.

When consumers use a product for the complexion such as a foundation they want this product to exhibit after application good hold on the skin and for example they do not want it to transfer onto clothes.

It is known to a person skilled in the art to use polymers in order to obtain these properties of lengthy hold during the day. These polymers have very different chemical natures and are generally carried either in a fatty phase or an aqueous phase. Mention may be made as examples of silicone resins polyacrylates and latexes. While these polymers may indeed contribute hold properties such as transfer free properties these properties may be accompanied by discomfort for example during the application of the product difficult spreading stickiness and or during the day tightness mask effect .

In the field of lipsticks good hold of the composition is also a requirement of consumers. It is generally obtained by using film forming polymers so as to limit color transfer. The production of polymer films on the lips can however be a source of discomfort for instance due to the tightening effects which the film forming polymer exerts on the labial mucous membrane.

Furthermore makeup compositions for the lips are frequently glossy or exhibit a glossy effect. This glossiness which makes it possible to enhance the lips is generally obtained by the formation of glossy oils and or of particles possessing glints. However the use of glossy oils may generate stickiness this sticky nature resulting in these compositions leaving traces on substrates such as glasses or coffee cups and thus transferring.

The need thus remains to have available polymers capable of being employed in making up the complexion which make it possible to simultaneously obtain good hold properties while retaining a certain comfort on use.

The need also remains to have available polymers capable of being employed in making up the lips which make it possible to simultaneously obtain a deposited layer which is comfortable glossy and free from transfer.

Accordingly one aspect of the disclosure is a method for making up the skin and or lips wherein a cosmetic makeup composition comprising in a cosmetically acceptable medium at least one polyalkene based supramolecular polymer is applied to the skin and or lips.

Another aspect of the disclosure is a cosmetic composition for making up the skin and or lips comprising in a cosmetically acceptable medium at least one polyalkene based supramolecular polymer and at least one coloring material.

An adhesive ring having an internal diameter of 24 mm and a thickness of 250 m was fixed to the nonadhesive face of the substrate. The composition was applied inside the ring and was levelled with a glass slide in order to obtain a deposited layer of the composition with a thickness of 250 m then the ring was removed and drying was allowed to take place in an oven at 37 C. for 20 hours.

The substrate was subsequently adhesively bonded via its adhesive face to an endpiece with a diameter of 27 mm fixed to a press STATIF MANUEL SV 1 from Imada Co. Ltd equipped with a tensile testing machine DPS 5R from Imada Co. Ltd .

A strip with a width of 4 cm and a length of 21 cm was drawn on a photographic grade coated paper reference Epson S041061 of 102 g m 5 compartments each having a length of 4.2 cm were drawn in this strip along the longitudinal axis of the strip. The paper was placed on the bed of the press.

The substrate comprising the sample of composition was then pressed onto the first compartment of the paper strip at a force of 4 kg exerted for 5 seconds. The paper was displaced in a rectilinear and uniform manner over the entire length of the strip so that the substrate was in contact with the entire length of the strip. The rate of displacement of the strip was of the order of 10 cm s.

The trail of product deposited on the paper strip was observed visually. A grade ranging respectively from 0.5 to 5 in increments of 0.5 was assigned according to the number of compartments from the first to the fifth traversed in all or part by the possible trail of product.

Grade 5 was assigned in the case where the trail of product reached the end of the fifth compartment or beyond.

Grade 5 was also assigned when by observation after having performed the relative displacement between the paper and substrate substantially no product less than 10 remained on the substrate. In the latter case the transfer may be described as total.

Grade 5 was also assigned when the trail of product extended beyond the fifth compartment independently of the amount of product remaining on the substrate.

Grade 0 was assigned in the case where no product present on the substrate had transferred onto the paper strip. In this case no visible trace could be observed on the sheet. The transfer may be described as zero.

By convention the line of separation between compartment n and compartment n 1 formed part of compartment n.

The way in which the other grades were assigned according to the spot on compartments 1 to 5 where the trail of product stops is illustrated in the table below. For these grades a greater or lesser amount of product remained on the substrate. The transfer may be described as partial.
