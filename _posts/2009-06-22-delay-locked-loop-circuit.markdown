The present invention claims priority of Korean patent application number 10 2008 0121233 filed on Dec. 2 2008 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to a delay locked loop circuit and more particularly to a delay locked loop circuit capable of preventing the malfunction due to the glitch of a clock.

As shown in the conventional delay locked loop circuit having the single loop structure may include a clock buffering block a phase comparing block a delaying block a replica modeling block and a pulse generating block .

The clock buffering block outputs an input clock REF CLK by buffering an external clock EXT CLK. The clock buffering block is inactivated in response to a buffer control signal BUF EN that is enabled when the delay locked loop circuit enters a power down mode and at this time the input clock REF CLK is disabled. The clock being disabled means that the clock is not toggled.

The phase comparing block compares the input clock REF CLK with a feedback clock FB CLK outputted from the replica modeling block and outputs a phase comparison signal CMP including information for a phase difference of the input clock REF CLK and the feedback clock FB CLK to the delaying block wherein the feedback clock FB CLK is obtained by modeling components of delaying a clock inside a semiconductor memory device.

The delaying block determines a delay amount in response to the phase comparison signal CMP and outputs an internal clock CLK OUT by delaying the input clock REF CLK by the delay amount.

The internal clock CLK OUT is coupled to the replica modeling block . If the phase of the input clock REF CLK is consistent with that of the feedback clock FB CLK through the above process i.e. the delay locking locking is achieved.

The pulse generating block generates a plurality of pulse signals P  to P N enabled by being synchronized with the input clock REF CLK to control operations of the phase comparing block and the delaying block . Namely the phase comparing block and the delaying block are enabled in response to a part or all of the pulse signals P  to P N. To perform the delay locking operation a sequence of operations such as the operation of comparing the phases and the operation of delaying the input clock REF CLK should be sequentially performed in combination with a clock. The pulse generating block controls the delay locking operation to be sequentially performed.

For instance the pulse generating block generates a first pulse signal to a twelfth pulse signal P  to P  and the phase comparing block is activated in response to the second pulse signal P  to output the phase comparison signal CMP. The delaying block is activated in response to the sixth pulse signal P  that is enabled after the second pulse signal P  is enabled thereby delaying the input clock REF CLK. The number or kind of the pulse signals used in the phase comparing block and the delaying block may be changed according to the constitution of the phase comparing block and the delaying block . For example in case the delaying block performs a coarse delay operation and a fine delay operation the coarse delay operation may be performed in response to the sixth pulse signal P  and the fine delay operation may be performed in response to the ninth pulse signal P . Furthermore the number or kind of the pulse signals may be changed according to the constitution of the delay locked loop circuit. The pulse generating block will be described in detail with reference to .

Referring to the conventional delay locked loop circuit having the dual loop structure includes a clock buffering block a first delay locking block a second delay locking block a duty rate correcting block and a pulse generating block .

The construction and operations of the clock buffering block and the pulse generating block are similar to those of the clock buffering block and the pulse generating block in . Each of the first and the second delay locking blocks and includes a phase comparing sector a delaying sector and a replica modeling sector like the construction of the delay locked loop circuit in and is controlled by a plurality of pulse signals P  to P N generated by the pulse generating block . Since the second delay locking block inverts an input clock REF CLK and outputs an inverted input clock in connection with a duty rate correcting operation performed in the duty rate correcting block a phase of a rising edge of a first internal clock CLK OUT is consistent with that of a second internal clock CLK OUT and a duty rate of the first internal clock CLK OUT is opposite to that of the second internal clock CLK OUT.

The duty rate correcting block corrects duty rates of the first and second internal clocks CLK OUT and CLK OUT by combining the phases of the first and second internal clocks CLK OUT and CLK OUT thereby outputting a first and a second corrected clock CLK CC and CLK CC. As described above since the phase of the rising edge of the first internal clock CLK OUT is consistent with that of the second internal clock CLK OUT the duty rate correcting block combines phases of falling edges of the first and second internal clocks CLK OUT and CLK OUT.

The shift register shifts a pulse control signal START by synchronizing the pulse control signal START outputted from the pulse control sector with the input clock REF CLK and generates the plurality of pulse signals P  to P  that are sequentially enabled. The shift register includes a first to a twelfth flip flop to serially connected to each other wherein each of the first to twelfth flip flops to shifts its input signal by one period of the input clock REF CLK to output a corresponding one of the plurality of pulse signals P  to P .

The pulse control sector detects a period of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  and enables the pulse control signal START for every period.

The first flip flop outputs the first pulse signal P  that is enabled at a high level by synchronizing the pulse control signal START enabled at a high level with a rising edge of the input clock REF CLK. The first pulse signal P  is inputted to the second flip flop . The second flip flop generates the second pulse signal P  that is enabled as being delayed by one period of the input clock REF CLK from the first pulse signal P . Similarly the third to the twelfth flip flops to shift output signals of their previous flip flops by one period of the input clock REF CLK and output the shifted signals as the third to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  that are sequentially enabled.

The pulse control sector enables the pulse control signal START in response to the twelfth pulse signal P  and disables the pulse control signal START in response to the first pulse signal P . Therefore the first flip flop enables the first pulse signal P  again in response to the pulse control signal START and the pulse signals P  to P  become pulse signals having a predetermined period. The pulse signals inputted to the pulse control sector can be changed and the period of the first to the twelfth pulse signals can be adjusted according to the pulse signals inputted to the pulse control sector . For instance if the pulse control signal START is enabled in response to the sixth pulse signal P  the period of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  becomes shorter.

The pulse control sector includes an OR gate an SR latch and a NOR gate . An output signal of the OR gate receiving the twelfth pulse signal P  and a reset signal RESET is inputted to an input node R of the SR latch . The first pulse signal P  is inputted to an input node S of the SR latch . Since the first and twelfth pulse signals P  and P  are disabled at a low level before the reset signal RESET is disabled the reset signal RESET is inputted to the OR gate so as to establish an initial value of the SR latch and enable the pulse control signal START in the early stage of the operation.

The SR latch makes a logic level of an A node being a low level in response to the twelfth pulse signal P  and a logic level of the A node being a high level in response to the first pulse signal P . The SR latch maintains the logic level of the A node at the high level while the first pulse signal P  and the twelfth pulse signal P  are disabled.

If the reset signal RESET is changed from an enabled state having a high level to a disabled state having a low level the logic level of the A node is maintained at the low level by the SR latch . The pulse control signal START is enabled at a high level after the reset signal RESET is disabled at the low level by the NOR gate receiving the reset signal RESET. The first pulse signal P  is enabled at a high level in response to the pulse control signal START that is enabled.

Referring to if the reset signal RESET is disabled at the low level from the high level the pulse control signal START is enabled at the high level by the pulse control sector . The shift register is synchronized with the input clock REF CLK in response to the pulse control signal START and generates the plurality of pulse signals P  to P  that are sequentially enabled. The pulse control sector outputs the pulse control signal START that is enabled in response to the twelfth pulse signal P  and disabled in response to the first pulse signal P .

Referring to the input clock REF CLK is disabled when the delay locked loop circuit enters the power down mode and enabled again when the delay locked loop circuit exits from the power down mode. In case the delay locked loop circuit enters the power down mode after the first pulse signal P  is enabled the enabled state of the first pulse signal P  is maintained as the input clock REF CLK is disabled. Then in case the delay locked loop circuit exits from the power down mode the glitch may occur in the input clock REF CLK. Since the operation of the shift register becomes unstable due to the glitch the first flip flop disables the first pulse signal P  in response to the glitch and the second pulse signal P  is not enabled in case the second flip flop does not respond to the glitch. Therefore the shift register does not enable the pulse signals anymore.

After all in the conventional delay locked loop circuit in case a certain pulse signal is disabled by external noise or the glitch of the clock that can occur when the delay locked loop circuit exits from the power down mode the shift register does not enable the pulse signals P  to P  sequentially and thus the delay locked loop circuit operating in response to the plurality of pulse signals P  to P  may not perform its operation.

Embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing a delay locked loop circuit capable of preventing the mal operation due to the glitch of a clock.

In accordance with an aspect of the present invention there is provided a delay locked loop circuit including a delay locking block configured to delay an input clock and output the delayed input clock as an internal clock to compensate a skew of an external clock and the internal clock a pulse generating block configured to sequentially output a plurality of pulse signals that controls an operation of the delay locking block and enable one of the plurality of pulse signals in response to a detection signal wherein the plurality of pulse signals is shifted by being synchronized with the input clock and a pulse detecting block configured to output the detection signal in case all of the plurality of pulse signals are disabled.

The pulse detecting block may include a detecting sector configured to detect whether the plurality of pulse signals are disabled or not and an enabling sector configured to enable the detection signal for a certain period according to the detection result of the detecting sector.

The pulse generating block may include a shift register configured to generate the plurality of pulse signals by shifting a pulse control signal and a pulse control sector configured to enable the pulse control signal for every period of the plurality of pulse signals and enable the pulse control signal regardless of the period of the plurality of pulse signals in case the detection signal is disabled after the certain period.

In accordance with an aspect of the present invention there is provided a delay locked loop circuit including a delay locking block configured to delay an input clock and output the delayed input clock as an internal clock a pulse generating block comprising a shift register and configured to sequentially output a plurality of pulse signals that are shifted in the shift register and control an operation of the delay locking block wherein a pulse signal of the plurality of pulse signals is enabled in response to a detection signal and a pulse detecting block configured to output the detection signal when all of the plurality of pulse signals are disabled.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention can be understood by the following description and become apparent with reference to the embodiments of the present invention.

Referring to the delay locked loop circuit includes a delay locking block for delaying an input clock REF CLK and outputting a delayed input clock as an internal clock CLK OUT to compensate the skew of an external clock EXT CLK and the internal clock CLK OUT a pulse generating block for controlling an operation of the delay locking block sequentially outputting a plurality of pulse signals P  to P N that are shifted by being synchronized with the input clock REF CLK and enabling one of the plurality of pulse signals P  to P N in response to a detection signal ALL LOW in response to determining that all of the plurality of pulse signals P  to P N are disabled and a pulse detecting block for outputting the detection signal ALL LOW in case all of the plurality of pulse signals P  to P N are disabled.

The delay locked loop circuit may further include a clock buffering block that outputs the input clock REF CLK by buffering the external clock EXT CLK and is inactivated in a power down mode.

The delay locked loop circuit includes the pulse detection block unlike the conventional delay locked loop circuit. The pulse detection block detects the case where all of the pulse signals P  to P N outputted from the pulse generating block are disabled and outputs the detection signal ALL LOW that is enabled to the pulse generating block to enable one of the pulse signals P  to P N in case all of the pulse signals P  to P N are disabled by the glitch of the input clock REF CLK or external noise. Since the pulse signals P  to P N generated from the pulse generating block are generated by shifting their respective previous pulse signals if one of the pulse signals P  to P N is enabled in response to the detection signal ALL LOW the pulse generating block can generate the pulse signals P  to P N that are sequentially enabled again. Accordingly the delay locking block can sequentially perform a delay locking operation in response to the plurality of pulse signals P  to P N.

Hereinafter the operation of the delay locked loop circuit in accordance with the present invention will be described in detail.

The delay locking block includes a phase comparing sector for comparing phases of the input clock REF CLK and a feedback clock FB CLK to generate a phase comparison signal CMP a delaying sector for delaying the input clock REF CLK in response to the phase comparison signal CMP to output the internal clock CLK OUT and a replica modeling sector for receiving the internal clock CLK OUT and outputting the feedback clock FB CLK.

The phase comparing sector compares the input clock REF CLK and the feedback clock FB CLK outputted from the replica modeling sector that is obtained by modeling components of delaying a clock inside a semiconductor memory device thereby outputting the phase comparison signal CMP that includes information for a phase difference of the input clock REF CLK and the feedback clock FB CLK to the delaying sector .

The delaying sector determines a delay amount in response to the phase comparison signal CMP and outputs the internal clock CLK OUT by delaying the input clock REF CLK by the delay amount. The internal clock CLK OUT is coupled to the replica modeling sector . If the phase of the input clock REF CLK is consistent with that of the feedback clock FB CLK through the above process i.e. the delay locking locking is achieved.

Meanwhile the clock buffering block disables the input clock REF CLK in response to a buffer control signal BUF EN that is enabled when the delay locked loop circuit enters the power down mode. The buffer control signal BUF EN may be generated from a clock enable signal CKE inputted from a memory controller. According to a device design scheme the delay locked loop circuit may enter the power down mode by making the external clock EXT CLK off when the external clock EXT CLK is inputted to the semiconductor memory device. In this case the semiconductor memory device may make the external clock EXT CLK off in response to the clock enable signal CKE and the delay locked loop circuit in accordance with the present invention may output the internal clock CLK OUT by delaying the external clock EXT CLK without employing the clock buffering block .

The pulse generating block generates the pulse signals P  to P N that are sequentially enabled by being synchronized with the input clock REF CLK to thereby control the operation of the delay locking block especially operations of the phase comparing sector and the delaying sector . That is the pulse generating block controls the delaying sector to be activated after the phase comparing sector is activated so that the delaying sector uses the comparison result of the phase comparing sector and thus the delay locking operation is sequentially performed.

In the meantime the number or kind of the pulse signals used in the phase comparing sector and the delaying sector may be changed according to the constitution of the phase comparing sector and the delaying sector . Furthermore the number or kind of the pulse signals may be changed according to the constitution of the delay locked loop circuit.

The pulse detecting block outputs the detection signal ALL LOW that is enabled to the pulse generating block in case all of the pulse signals P  to P N are disabled. If one of the pulse signals P  to P N is enabled in response to the detection signal ALL LOW the pulse generating block generates the pulse signals P  to P N that are sequentially enabled again. Meanwhile as the pulse detecting block generates the detection signal ALL LOW the pulse generating block enables one of the pulse signals P  to P N that are disabled in response to the detection signal ALL LOW. Therefore the pulse detecting block can be considered that it enables one of the pulse signals P  to P N.

Unlike the conventional delay locked loop circuit the delay locked loop circuit in accordance with the present invention can prevent its malfunction due to external noise or the glitch of a clock since the pulse signals P  to P N can be enabled again although all of the pulse signals P  to P N are disabled.

The detailed operations of the pulse generating block and the detecting block will be described with reference to .

Referring to the pulse generating block includes a shift register for generating the plurality of pulse signals P  to P N by shifting a pulse control signal START and a pulse control sector enables the pulse control signal START for every period of the pulse signals P  to P N and enables the pulse control signal START regardless of the period of the pulse signals P  to P N in response to the detection signal ALL LOW.

The case where the pulse generating block generates the pulse signals P  to P N e.g. a first to a twelfth pulse signal P  to P  by being synchronized with the input clock REF CLK will be described as an example.

The shift register includes a first to a twelfth flip flop to that are serially connected to each other and each of which shifts its input signal by one period of the input clock REF CLK to output a corresponding one of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P . The number of the flip flops can be changed according to the number of the pulse signals.

The first flip flop outputs the first pulse signal P  that is enabled at a high level by synchronizing the pulse control signal START that is enabled at a high level with a rising edge of the input clock REF CLK. The first pulse signal P  is inputted to the second flip flop . The second flip flop generates the second pulse signal P  that is enabled by shifting the first pulse signal P  by one period of the input clock REF CLK. Similarly the third to twelfth flip flops to shift output signals of their previous flip flops by one period of the input clock REF CLK and output the shifted signals as the third to the twelfth pulse signals P  to P  that are sequentially enabled.

The pulse control sector enables the pulse control signal START in response to the twelfth pulse signal P  among the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  and disables the pulse control signal START in response to the first pulse signal P . That is since the pulse control sector enables the pulse control signal START for every period of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  become pulse signals having a predetermined period.

Meanwhile the pulse control sector enables the pulse control signal START in response to the detection signal ALL LOW outputted from the pulse detecting block regardless of the period of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P . As described above since the shift register generates the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  by shifting the pulse control signal START the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  are sequentially enabled if the pulse control signal START is enabled by the detection signal ALL LOW. Since the first pulse signal P  is enabled if the pulse control signal START is enabled the detecting block can be considered that it enables the first pulse signal P  i.e. one of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P .

As the shift register receives a clock that is obtained by multiplying or dividing the input clock REF CLK the period of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  can be adjusted. For instance in case the shift register receives a clock that is obtained by dividing the input clock REF CLK by a pulse width of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  becomes 2 times of that in case the shift register receives the input clock REF CLK. Therefore the period of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  becomes 2 times compared to that of the input clock REF CLK.

The pulse control sector includes an OR gate an SR latch and a NOR gate . An output signal of the OR gate receiving the twelfth pulse signal P  a reset signal RESET and the detection signal ALL LOW is coupled to an input node R of the SR latch . Therefore the pulse control sector enables the pulse control signal START in response to either the reset signal RESET and the detection signal ALL LOW. The first pulse signal P  is provided to an input node S of the SR latch . Since the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  are disabled at a low level before the reset signal RESET is disabled the reset signal RESET is inputted to the OR gate to establish an initial value of the SR latch and enable the pulse control signal START in the early stage of the operation.

The SR latch makes a logic level of an A node to be a low level in response to an output signal of the OR gate and a logic level of the A node to be a high level in response to the first pulse signal P . The SR latch maintains the logic level of the A node to the high level while the first pulse signal P  and the twelfth pulse signal P  are disabled.

If the reset signal RESET is changed from an enabled state having a high level to a disabled state having a low level the logic level of the A node is maintained at the low level by the SR latch . The pulse control signal START is enabled at the high level after the reset signal RESET is disabled at the low level by the NOR gate receiving the reset signal RESET. The first pulse signal P  is enabled at the high level in response to the pulse control signal START that is enabled.

The detection signal ALL LOW is a pulse signal enabled for a certain period. Therefore if all of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  are disabled and thus the detection signal ALL LOW is enabled to be at the high level and then disabled to be at the low level the logic level of the A node is maintained to the low level. Accordingly as in the case where the pulse control sector receives the reset signal RESET the pulse control signal START is enabled at the high level regardless of the period of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P .

Referring to the pulse detecting block includes a detecting sector for detecting whether the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  are disabled or not and an enabling sector for enabling the detection signal ALL LOW for the certain period wherein the detection signal ALL LOW is used to enable one of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P .

The detecting sector includes a plurality of NOR gates or NAND gates receiving the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  and makes a logic level of a B node being a high level in case all of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  are disabled at the low level. The enabling sector outputs the detection signal ALL LOW that is a pulse signal enabled at the high level for the certain period if the logic level of the B node becomes the high level.

In case any one of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  is enabled at the high level the logic level of the B node is the low level and the enabling sector outputs the detection signal ALL LOW disabled at the low level.

Referring to the pulse generating block includes a shift register including a plurality of flip flops to serially connected to each other to generate a plurality of pulse signals P  to P  by shifting the pulse control signal START a pulse control sector for enabling the pulse control signal START for every period of the pulse signals P  to P  and a recovering sector for enabling one of output signals of the plurality of flip flops to in response to the detection signal ALL LOW.

The construction of the shift register is the same as that of the shift register in . The construction of the pulse control sector is the same as that of the pulse control sector in except that the pulse control sector does not receive the detection signal ALL LOW.

The recovering sector enables the eighth pulse signal P  that is an output signal of the eighth flip flop in response to the detection signal ALL LOW. shows the recovering sector including a PMOS transistor that is turned on in response to the detection signal ALL LOW to transfer a supply voltage VDD and enabling the eighth pulse signal P  as an example.

In case the recovering sector enables the eighth pulse signal P  the ninth flip flop outputs the ninth pulse signal P  by synchronizing the eighth pulse signal P  with the input clock REF CLK. Accordingly the ninth to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  are sequentially enabled and the pulse control sector enables the pulse control signal START in response to the twelfth pulse signal P . After all the pulse generating block sequentially enables the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  again.

Referring to the pulse detecting block includes a detecting sector for detecting whether the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  are disabled or not and an enabling sector for enabling the detection signal ALL LOW by synchronizing the detection signal ALL LOW with the input clock REF CLK wherein the detection signal ALL LOW enables one of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  according to the result of the detecting sector .

The construction of the detecting sector is the same as that of the detecting sector in . Unlike the enabling sector in the enabling sector enables the detection signal ALL LOW by synchronizing the result of the detecting sector with the input clock REF CLK. The enabling sector may include a flip flop as an example.

In case the recovering sector enables the eighth pulse signal P  in since the detecting sector changes a logic level of a B node from the high level to the low level the detection signal ALL LOW is not sufficiently enabled at the low level and thus the ninth flip flop may not latch the eight pulse signal P  enabled at a rising edge of the input clock REF CLK. Therefore the enabling sector enables the detection signal ALL LOW by synchronizing the detection signal ALL LOW with the input clock REF CLK so that the ninth flip flop fully latches the eighth pulse signal P  that is enabled.

Meanwhile since the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  are disabled in case the reset signal RESET is enabled at the high level the logic level of the B node becomes the high level. Accordingly since the detection signal ALL LOW is enabled and thus the eighth pulse signal P  may be enabled the enabling sector receives the reset signal RESET and enables the detection signal ALL LOW only when the reset signal RESET is disabled. Although the case where the enabling sector receives the reset signal RESET is only described as an example the pulse detection block may be constructed to be activated only when the reset signal REST is disabled by fixing the logic level of the B node of the pulse detecting block to the low level using the reset signal RESET.

Referring to if the reset signal RESET is disabled to be at the low level from the high level the pulse control signal START is enabled at the high level by the pulse control sector . The shift register generates the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  that are synchronized with the input clock REF CLK in response to the pulse control signal START and sequentially enabled. The pulse control sector enables the pulse control signal START in response to the twelfth pulse signal P  and disables the pulse control signal START in response to the first pulse signal P .

The input clock REF CLK is off when the delay locked loop circuit enters the power down mode and on when the delay locked loop circuit exits from the power down mode. In case the delay locked loop circuit enters the power down mode after the first pulse signal P  is enabled as the input clock REF CLK is off the first pulse signal P  maintains its enabled state. After then in case the delay locked loop circuit exits from the power down mode the glitch may occur in the input clock REF CLK. Since the operation of the shift register becomes unstable by the glitch the first flip flop disables the first pulse signal P  in response to the glitch and the second pulse signal P  is not enabled in case the second flip flop does not respond to the glitch.

In this case that is the case all of the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  are disabled the detecting sector makes the logic level of the B node being the high level and the enabling sector outputs the detection signal ALL LOW of a pulse type that is enabled at the high level. The pulse control sector enables the pulse control signal START to the high level in response to the detection signal ALL LOW and the shift register sequentially enables the first to twelfth pulse signals P  to P  in response to the pulse control signal START. Therefore the delay locked loop circuit in accordance with the present invention can perform the locking operation without the mal operation although the glitch occurs in the input clock REF CLK.

In accordance with the present invention it is possible to prevent the malfunction of the delay locked loop circuit by enabling one of the pulse signals to make the pulse generating block generate the pulse signals that are sequentially enabled in case all of the pulse signals generated from the pulse generating block of the delay locked loop circuit are disabled by the glitch.

While the present invention has been described with respect to the specific embodiments it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.
