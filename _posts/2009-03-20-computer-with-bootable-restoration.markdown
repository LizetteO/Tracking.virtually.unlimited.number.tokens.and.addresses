title: Computer with bootable restoration
abstract: A bootable restoration computer includes: at least one mass storage device; at least two mass storage device partitions in the at least one mass storage device, including first and second partitions; a partition image restoration program; at least one partition image; at least one human interface device; a primary operating system with graphical user interface; a secondary operating system; and, a boot loader responsive to the human interface device that provides for selecting between the primary secondary operating systems. The primary operating system resides on the first partition and is configured so that its standard locations for storing user-created files are folders rooted on at least one of any partition other than the first partition. The at least one partition image is an image of the first partition, and resides on at least one of any partition other than the first partition. If no opportunity is taken to select the secondary operating system in a predefined time, the computer loads the primary operating system. If the opportunity is taken, the partition image restoration program restores the partition image to the first partition.

The present invention resides in the field of computers and is particularly advantageous for personal computers where user skills range from professional to minimal. It is directed to a personal computer in which a manufacturer programmed state can be restored without the loss of user files. It is especially useful against aging spyware installation user error and virus invasion.

Backup and recovery methods for personal computers and most other computers have been evolving for a decade fueled predominantly by the advent of partition image backup and restoration programs. A partition image is a sector based copy of the contents of a mass storage device partition. Thus a partition image contains both file folder data and locational information relating thereto. A partition image backup and restoration program makes an exact copy of an entire mass storage device partition in the form of a partition image. The user performs a recovery operation by booting the computer to the partition image backup and restoration program which mounts the partition image to the originating mass storage device partition from which the image was made. Such a method requires the user to make a newer partition image whenever he acquires creates or modifies files. A typical user neither possesses nor wishes to learn the skill necessary to create new partition images and might find the need for such maintenance objectionable. Consequently the use of a Partition Image Backup and Restoration Program will likely result in the loss of the user s most recent files. Moreover a user who makes frequent partition images is faced with a dilemma wherein a recent partition image that contains all of the user s files may also contain the kind of corruption or degradation of the operating system for which backup and recovery is sought thus obviating its benefit.

In light of the aforementioned compromises other methods of protecting the functionality and integrity of the operating system have been developed as interim alternatives to whole partition imaging. To wit System File Checker SFC performs a check to verify that critical system files have not been altered or replaced. While this method affords protection of some files other damage may occur that renders the personal computer unusable due to corruption of files that fall outside the scope of the System File Checker. Furthermore it may be necessary or desirable to replace one or more protected system files and such a protection scheme may actually interfere with legitimate and desired modification and reconfiguration of the operating system.

Another prior art solution to the problem of protecting a computer such as a personal computer is usually known as System Restore which periodically creates backup copies of selected system configuration files that the user can employ to roll back the operating system to a previous configuration state. Such a scheme burdens the user because these restore points as they are called must be clearly and verbosely documented if the user is to discern which restore point is right for a given situation. Also rolling back the system might evoke a conflict between the older configuration files that are restored and the newer files that remain.

Again neither the System File Checker nor the System Restore provide protection for the whole operating system and all of its constituent parts. Worse still is the allocation of resources and speed and performance degradation that accompanies the use of the System File Checker and the System Restore.

Still more invasive methods of protecting computer integrity and functionality exist wherein third party application programs are installed to scan for viruses and spyware. These methods invariably fail because of the incessant need to update the software with the latest spyware and virus definitions that are required literally on a daily basis. Equally troubling is the deep intrusion into the quality of the user s computing experience perpetrated by such software which seeks to scan every file that is written to the mass storage device partition. As was the case with the System File Checker and the System Restore there is also a performance speed and resource penalty to be paid even more so in the case of anti virus and anti spyware software.

The present invention relates to a computer especially a personal computer in which all of the benefits of partition image restoration are realized without compromise. A brief description of the concept follows 

Most desktop operating systems for example Windows XP Trademark of Microsoft Corporation One Microsoft Way Redmond Wash. 98052 USA provide directories or folders that it designates as standard locations for storing user created files. Sometimes these are called shell folders . In a typical personal computer a desktop operating system application programs and shell folders coexist on a mass storage device partition. In the present invention a primary operating system is configured so that certain shell folders the ones that are standard locations for storing user created files are rooted on a partition that is not cohabited by the primary operating system making it possible to wholly replace the primary operating system and application programs without threatening the user files. With the primary operating system so configured the user need not have special knowledge of where to safely store files rather all of the standard storage locations that the user might invoke in an application program are rooted on a distal partition.

The benefits of the present invention are more fully appreciated by considering an anecdotal example A user purchases a computer of the present invention and begins creating documents. Perhaps the user transfers pictures from a digital camera to the present invention computer. One day the user accidentally mutes the sound and cannot remember how to unmute. Instead of troubleshooting or seeking technical support the user reboots the computer whereupon the user is briefly provided an opportunity to load a partition image restoration program. The user may exercise this opportunity by selecting the partition image restoration program via keyboard mouse or other responsive human interface device. When the partition image restoration program completes and the computer is rebooted the primary operating system appears in its manufacturer programmed state as do any application programs that were included with the present invention computer. The user s documents and pictures remain intact because the primary operating system had been configured such that the standard locations for storing user created files are rooted on a distal partition of the mass storage device and or on separate secondary and or tertiary mass storage devices and the partition image restoration program did not write to that partition. If the user does not take the opportunity to use the partition image restoration program then when a predefined opportunity time passes the computer defaults to the primary operating system.

In the embodiments described below Windows XP is utilized as the primary operating system files obtained from a Windows 98SE boot floppy image are used as the secondary operating system and the Windows XP installer provides the boot loader. Nevertheless any operating system may be used as the primary operating system of the present invention such as Linux and any widely available boot loader may be employed such as GRUB or LILO. Further the secondary operating system of the present invention need not utilize files obtained from a Windows 98SE boot floppy image many widely available DOS equivalent operating systems are viable substitutes.

Referring now to mass storage device is contained within otherwise conventional computer . Computer has standard computer components connections and functionalities not shown and any available computer could be used. Mass storage device has partitions and designated by Windows as drive letters C and D respectively . Partition utilizes the FAT32 file system and has partition image restoration program and secondary operating system files as follows AUTOEXEC.BAT COMMAND.COM IMAGE.EXE IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS . AUTOEXEC.BAT and MSDOS.SYS contain ASCII code set forth in Tables 1a and 2 respectively while COMMAND.COM and IO.SYS are obtained from a Windows 98SE boot floppy image. IMAGE.EXE is a partition image restoration program of TeraByte Incorporated doing business as TeraByte Unlimited currently located in Las Vegas Nev. USA .

Partition further includes boot loader files as follows boot.ini bootsect.dos NTDETECT.COM and ntldr . Bootsect.dos is created by the Windows XP installer based upon the preexistence of the Windows 98SE files. Bootsect.dos allows boot loader files to simulate the boot procedure of Windows 98SE. Boot loader ntldr is responsive to boot configuration file boot.ini the Windows XP installer appends boot.ini so that a prompt screen is shown at boot that includes a thirty second opportunity for selecting the Windows 98SE files it detected. The thirty second period and the text of the prompt screen can be changed by editing the text in boot.ini as shown in Table 3 below.

Once the Windows XP installer has progressed past the point at which it created bootsect.dos MSDOS.SYS becomes unneeded and may be safely deleted. Indeed the reason that the Windows 98SE content was placed on partition prior to installing Windows XP was so that the Windows XP installer would detect it and provide a proper boot loader configuration.

Partition further has folders as follows Documents and Settings Program Files and WINDOWS . Documents and Settings Program Files and WINDOWS are folders of the primary operating system. Contrary to its name a Documents and Settings folder of the present invention houses user settings but not user documents. Documents and Settings is merely a name given by the Windows XP installer. This is an important semantic when studying as well as subsequent drawing figures because an object of the present invention is that the user settings share a common partition with the primary operating system where they will be overwritten by the partition image restoration program. By contrast some prior art restorable computers place user settings outside of the primary operating system partition a drawback considering the frequency at which users corrupt those settings.

Partition may utilize either NTFS NT File System or FAT32 File Allocation Table 32 bit and has folders as follows Desktop My Documents My Music My Pictures and Videos . The primary operating system is configured to treat folders as standard locations for storing user created files by way of registry code shown in Table 4a below.

Referring now to a flowchart depicting a boot process of the present invention is shown. First the computer is restarted or started . A prompt screen is displayed pictured in with the primary operating system preselected and a predefined countdown begins . If the user presents no input to a responsive human interface device HID e.g. the keyboard the predefined countdown lapses and the process proceeds directly to loading the primary operating system . If the user offers any keystroke the countdown halts and the prompt screen persists until the Enter key is pressed. If the user presses the up arrow key or the down arrow key the prompt screen no longer has the primary operating system selected but instead has the partition image restoration program selected which will load if the user presses enter . If the primary operating system remains selected it will load when the user presses Enter .

Referring now to prompt screen displays for a predefined time whose passage is visible via countdown display . Prompt screen presents an opportunity for a user to select the secondary operating system. Selection stripe is shown highlighting the primary operating system boot option. Selection stripe is responsive to human interface device and may be so moved so that it highlights secondary operating system boot option according to user input. Prompt screen is designed to always open with stripe on the primary operating system.

Instead of text a prompt screen of the present invention could show at least one icon or other graphics. Indeed a prompt of the present invention computer could be an audio prompt giving human voice instructions thereby obviating a prompt screen altogether.

In some forthcoming embodiments a plurality of application programs is included with the present invention. Specifically a web browser called Opera Trademark of Opera Software ASA Waldemar Thranes gate 98 NO 0175 Oslo Norway Telephone 47 24 16 40 00 and an email client application program called Outlook Trademark of Microsoft Corporation One Microsoft Way Redmond Wash. 98052 USA are included.

Referring now to mass storage device is contained within a computer not shown and has partitions and designated by Windows as drive letters C and D respectively . Partition utilizes the FAT32 file system and has partition image restoration program and secondary operating system files as follows AUTOEXEC.BAT COMMAND.COM IMAGE.EXE IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS . AUTOEXEC.BAT and MSDOS.SYS contain ASCII code set forth in Tables 1a and 2 respectively while COMMAND.COM and IO.SYS are obtained from a Windows 98SE boot floppy image. IMAGE.EXE is a partition image restoration program of TeraByte Incorporated.

Partition further includes boot loader files as follows boot.ini bootsect.dos NTDETECT.COM and ntldr . Bootsect.dos is created by the Windows XP installer based upon the preexistence of the Windows 98SE files. Bootsect.dos allows boot loader files to simulate the boot procedure of Windows 98SE. Boot loader ntldr is responsive to boot configuration file boot.ini the Windows XP installer appends boot.ini so that a prompt screen is shown at boot that includes a thirty second opportunity for selecting the Windows 98SE files it detected. The thirty second period and the text of the prompt screen can be changed by editing the text in boot.ini as shown in Table 3 above.

Partition further has folders as follows Documents and Settings Program Files Opera profile opera6.ini a configuration file Outlook and WINDOWS . Documents and Settings Program Files and WINDOWS are folders of the primary operating system. Within Program Files of folders Outlook is the main application program folder of the Outlook email client and Opera is the main application program folder of the Opera web browser within the Opera folder a folder named profile contains configuration file opera6.ini discussed below .

Partition may utilize either NTFS or the FAT32 file system and has folders as follows Desktop My Documents My Music My Pictures Opera Bookmarks Outlook and Videos . The primary operating system is configured to treat Desktop My Documents My Music My Pictures and Videos of folders as standard locations for storing user created files by way of registry code shown in Table 4a above. The Opera web browser is configured to store bookmarks in the Opera Bookmarks folder of folders by way of INI code contained within file opera6.ini shown in Table 5a above while the Outlook email client is configured to store email in the Outlook folder of folders by way of registry code shown in Table 6a above.
