This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 135 495 filed Jul. 21 2008 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The invention was made with U.S. Government support under Grant No. R21 EB006338 awarded by United States National Institutes of Health. Thus the U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

The subject matter described herein relates to phase imaging systems and techniques such as for use in biological research. More specifically the subject matter relates to methods systems and computer readable media for use in optical coherence tomography and spectral domain phase microscopy.

Recently there has been much interest in developing quantitative phase imaging techniques for use in biological research particularly at the cellular level e.g. detecting sub wavelength dynamics in biological samples . Techniques such as phase contrast and differential interference contrast microscopy have been used to image transparent samples by converting phase differences to intensity differences. These methods offer qualitative information about sample structure but suffer from a non linear phase to amplitude conversion thus they are unable to provide quantitative data. There has been much work in recent years to develop quantitative phase imaging techniques capable of detecting sub wavelength dynamics in biological samples.

For instance techniques such as phase contrast and differential interference contrast microscopy have been used to image transparent samples qualitatively by converting phase differences to intensity differences but these methods suffer from a non linear phase to amplitude conversion and thus do not directly provide quantitative data. In addition phase shifting interferometry digital holography Fourier phase microscopy and Hilbert phase microscopy are interferometric techniques that are capable of detecting nanometer scale features in biological specimens. These quantitative methods have applications in the realm of cellular imaging due to their high sensitivity and use of intrinsic contrast agents but they lack the ability to obtain depth resolved measurements from an optically thick sample.

The development of Fourier domain optical coherence tomography FDOCT particularly spectrometer based spectral domain systems with no moving parts spectral domain OCT or SDOCT has greatly enhanced the phase stability of optical coherence tomography OCT systems due to improvements to the system signal to noise ratio SNR over time domain systems. Common path implementations have given rise to a new class of functional nanometer scale sensitive quantitative phase microscopies termed spectral domain phase microscopy SDPM or spectral domain optical coherence phase microscopy SDOCPM . Other implementations of OCT including swept source OCT SSOCT optical frequency domain imaging OFDI also depend in some applications on phase unwrapping.

In SDPM phase information is obtained from Fourier processing as in standard SDOCT. The phase of a given depth sample represents sub coherence length changes in the optical path length through the sample as a function of time or a lateral dimension and can be caused by changes to the refractive index position of scattering objects or both. SDPM is capable of producing depth resolved phase maps measuring the motion of a dynamic sample throughout its volume. Using a common path geometry allows for cancellation of common mode noise and such systems have experimental phase sensitivities as low as 53 picometers. SDPM has been used to study cytoplasmic streaming in Amoeba using Doppler flow cytoskeletal rheology and contractile motion of beating cardiomyocytes. All the aforementioned phase imaging modalities can suffer from phase wrapping artifacts.

The phase in the OCT signal is linearly related to the sample motion over time. The measured phase is limited however to a range of to . An artifact known as phase wrapping occurs when a change in phase between consecutive measurements is such that the total phase change falls outside this range and thus wraps to the opposite end of the range yielding an ambiguous result. As SDPM operates in a reflection geometry changes in a sample reflector s position greater than half of the source center wavelength will induce phase wrapping. In some cases unwrapping the phase can be accomplished easily by adding or subtracting 2 to data points at jump discontinuities as long as the phase jump itself is no more than 2 . However if a jump greater than 2 is present this simple algorithm is no longer sufficient to correctly unwrap the phase.

Software implementations for phase unwrapping techniques have been used in SDPM but they are often complex and computationally intensive. For example one technique to resolve the 2 ambiguity in low coherence interferometery used a dispersion imbalance in the sample arm and polarization effects to simultaneously detect two interferograms from different lateral locations on a sample. This method required two spectrometer channels as well as additional polarization optics which add complexity to the optical setup.

The use of two or three illuminating wavelengths to perform more robust phase unwrapping was first introduced in phase shifting interferometry and has since been applied in digital holography and phase imaging interference microscopy. The difference in the phase information obtained at two or more wavelengths can be cast in terms of an equivalent phase that would be obtained at a longer synthetic wavelength which is a function of each of the imaging wavelengths. This method allows wrap free measurements of changes in optical path length less than 2 which can be significantly larger than any of the imaging wavelengths alone. A similar technique using a combination of low coherence and continuous wave sources was used to detect phase crossings in a Michelson interferometer allowing for phase wrap removal. These techniques require the use of multiple sources which also complicate the optical setup. A similar technique in broadband interferometric confocal microscopy measured the group optical path delay through a sample by detecting relative phase changes between different wavelengths allowing for measurement of the group refractive index while avoiding phase ambiguity.

Accordingly in light of these difficulties a need exists for improved methods systems and computer readable media for phase unwrapping of an OCT signal.

In accordance with this disclosure methods systems and computer readable media for synthetic wavelength based phase unwrapping in Fourier domain optical coherence tomography and spectral domain phase microscopy are provided. Synthetic wavelength phase unwrapping can be applied to OCT data and can correctly resolve sample motions that are larger than 2. According to one aspect of the presently disclosed subject matter a method for phase unwrapping of an OCT signal can include acquiring raw OCT signal data interpolating the raw OCT signal data to be evenly spaced in k processing the interpolated OCT signal data to obtain a direct current DC or background spectrum comparing the raw OCT signal data to the DC spectrum to generate an interference signal applying Gaussian windows to the interference signal to generate a first signal and a second signal processing the first signal and the second signal extracting phase information from each of the first signal and the second signal and comparing the phase information of the first signal to the phase information of the second signal to produce unwrapped phase data. A value of 2 can be added to the phase data if the difference between the phase information of the first signal and the second signal is less than zero.

It is noted that image processing in OCT can use the Fourier transform of a broadband spectrum. By windowing the signal spectrum before applying the Fourier transform phase information at multiple center wavelengths can be obtained. A similar procedure to the multi wavelength method previously used in other phase imaging modalities may then be applied for correct phase unwrapping except that in OCT only a single source is needed due to the large spectral bandwidth used. Windows can be centered at two different wavelengths to OCT spectra to measure and correctly unwrap quantitative phase data. Such a procedure can be applicable to other phase based implementations of OCT in both the Fourier or time domain including Doppler polarization sensitive or common path implementations. In addition the technique discussed herein can be readily extendable to more than two spectral windows e.g. up to a limit of as many windows as there are resolvable wavelengths and also to imaging systems with multiple non contiguous sources.

In other aspects the subject matter described herein for phase unwrapping of an OCT signal can be implemented using computer readable media to having stored thereon executable instructions that when executed by the processor of a computer control the processor to perform steps. Exemplary computer readable media suitable for implementing the subject matter described herein includes disk memory devices programmable logic devices and application specific integrated circuits. In one implementation the computer readable medium may include a memory accessible by a processor. The memory can include instructions executable by the processor for implementing any of the methods for phase unwrapping of an OCT signal described herein. In addition a computer readable medium that implements the subject matter described herein may be distributed across multiple physical devices and or computing platforms.

Although some of the aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein have been stated hereinabove and which are achieved in whole or in part by the presently disclosed subject matter other aspects will become evident as the description proceeds when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings as best described hereinbelow.

Methods systems and computer readable media are disclosed herein for synthetic wavelength based phase unwrapping in Fourier domain optical coherence tomography.

A SD OCT interferometric signal can be detected by a spectrometer. For the case of a single reflector this interferometric signal can be given as a function of wavenumber by the following equation i k S k R R square root over RR cos 2kn x x 1 where S k is the source spectral density Rand Rare the reference and sample reflectivities respectively n is the index of refraction and x x is the distance between the reference and sample reflectors. The value x can account for the discrete sampling of the detector in the x domain while x can represent subresolution changes in the sample position around x. It is noted that the first two terms in Eq. 1 represent DC terms while the third term contains the interferometric data of interest in OCT. Taking a Fourier transform of Eq. 1 and ignoring the DC terms can yield a depth reflectivity profile of the sample known as an A scan with peaks located at x 2nx. These peaks can be described by the following relationship 2 square root over 2 exp 2 2 in which S is the total source power E 2n x is the coherence envelope function kis the source center wavenumber. The phase of the detected signal at time tcan be used to detect subresolution deviations in the sample with respect to the phase at a reference time t. These deviations can be related to the detected phase as follows 

Accordingly a system of dual wavelength phase unwrapping can be used to account for the uncertainty regarding the sample motion and or structure. For two given wavelengths and a longer synthetic wavelength can be defined as follows 

The synthetic wavelength can have a corresponding synthetic phase which can be calculated by the difference of the phase measurements made at each of the two single wavelengths and then adding 2 to the result whenever is less than zero. is the phase one would obtain had been the actual illumination wavelength used and thus allows for wrap free phase measurements of a large x. can still suffer from phase wrapping however if is not chosen to be sufficiently large. It should also be noted that the noise level in the synthetic wavelength phase map can suffer from noise magnification due to amplification by as is discussed herein below.

In OCT and can correspond to the center wavelengths of two different subsets of the broadband source spectrum. The broadband spectrum acquired during SD OCT imaging can be divided by applying Gaussian windows to different portions of the spectrum as shown in through . The spectrum can first be interpolated to be evenly spaced in wavenumber See e.g. . The DC components of the signal can be isolated by low pass filtering the k space spectrum See e.g. . The raw spectrum can then be divided by the DC spectrum which leaves the interferometric term from Eq. 1 See e.g. . The Gaussian windows can be applied to the remaining interference signal See e.g. . The resulting signals can have the form

Extending this analysis to three or more windows can be done iteratively by calculating a new synthetic between the synthetic wavelength defined in Eq. 4 and a third wavelength. This analysis can thus be extended to an arbitrary number of additional wavelengths.

It is to be understood that the steps described in the previous paragraphs for windowing the OCT signal into two or more spectral regions for the purpose of generating a synthetic wavelength signal are exemplary. Variations or simplifications of these steps are also possible and do not differ from the essence of the presently disclosed subject matter. For example interpolation of the signal data from being evenly spaced in wavelength to evenly spaced in wavenumber can be done at any stage in the windowing process or not done at all if accurate depth sampling after the Fourier transform is not required. Similarly alternate steps may be substituted for generation of the DC spectrum and using it to correct the raw signal spectrum. For example the DC spectrum can also be generated from the average of many raw signal spectra acquired at different lateral sample locations and the DC spectrum may alternatively be subtracted from the raw signal spectrum. Also in some cases it may not be necessary to correct the raw signal spectrum with the DC spectrum at all. There are many possible approaches which are well known to those familiar with signal processing for windowing spectral data which include variations on the particular details described here.

As noted above Gaussian windows are advantageous for dual wavelength phase unwrapping as a particularly convenient form of OCT theory depends upon Gaussian shaped spectra. The source shape can affect the values calculated using phase and displacement relationships and non Gaussian sources can cause SNR loss and result in incorrect measurements of displacement values. Although Gaussian windows are a preferred aspect many other window shapes e.g. rectangular sine or cosine may also be used. The windowing can be performed after wavelength to wavenumber conversion if necessary in the signal processing chain.

In the shot noise limit the phase sensitivity of a reflector in an acquired OCT interferogram can be described by the following equation 

Several important observations can be made regarding Eqs. 6 7 and 8 . depends upon the integrated power at the detector and x is affected both by and . Each of the two spectra produced by windowing has phase noise and respectively. Because the synthetic wavelength phase noise depends on a quadrature addition of the noise levels of each spectra. The noise of each of the two spectra is correlated according to the amount of overlap of the two windows which can be described by their covariance. Thus the synthetic wavelength has a phase noise given by the following square root over cov 9 where cov is the covariance of the phase noise between the two spectra. As a first simple model for the covariance the following can be assumed cov 10 in which a k is a function describing the amount of overlap of the two Gaussian windows described as follows 

Important considerations can include the choice of the window width and the center wavelength of the window. Wrapping will occur if the difference between two consecutive measurements is greater than 2. Thus because as

It is important to note the distinction between and xin this analysis. approaches 0 as the separation between the windows decreases because the synthetic phase is based upon the difference between the measured phases of each window. When the windows are completely overlapped they possess complete correlation and thus their covariance is equal to the sum of their variances which from Eq. 9 yields 0. However xis not zero because approaches in this case. For situations where window separation is large becomes small while becomes large because the SNR of the windowed spectra degrades with increasing distance from the source center. Thus and act to balance each other keeping xnon zero and finite.

These observations indicate that the optimal choice of window placement over the original spectrum is determined by balancing the separation of the windows about the source center such that is sufficiently large to unwrap expected phase jumps and yet still maintains sufficient phase stability to keep xlow. illustrates the results of an example of such an analysis in which Experimental data was obtained from the surface of a glass coverslip as described below. Equation 13 can plotted theoretically using Eq. 9 and the SNR dependent expressions to determine . The measured SNR for the lower wavelength window decreased from 46.3 dB to 39.4 dB while that of the higher wavelength window decreased from 46.6 dB to 43 dB as the wavelength separation increased. Because the power of the source was less concentrated for wavelengths far from the source center the strength of the interference fringes was also reduced at these wavelengths. Experimentally is determined by the standard deviation of the measurements.

Another important consideration is that the coherence length for each of the resulting windows remains the same in order to ensure proper comparison of the phase at each pixel in depth. Because the synthetic wavelength method relies upon pixel to pixel comparisons between the two phase maps generated from windowing differences in the coherence lengths can cause the location of a scatterer to shift resulting in errors in the synthetic phase measurement.

A further consideration is the shape of the windowed spectra. Gaussian spectra can be useful to obtain a correct phase displacement relationship whereas a non Gaussian spectrum can result in phase data that is not entirely accurate after the Fourier transform. Therefore the DC spectrum can be divided out of the source from the acquired OCT spectrum and the two separate windows can be applied to the remaining data. This process can yield two Gaussians at separate center wavelengths. Taking a Fourier transform of each of these resulting spectra can yield the phase information needed. An alternative to dividing out the DC spectrum would be subtracting the DC spectrum from each acquired spectrum.

The wavenumber spectrum can also be corrected for dispersion before windowing takes place. Even slight dispersion imbalances between different wavelengths can cause errors in the dual wavelength algorithm. This allows for windows over wavelengths further from the source center to be used. Methods for dispersion correction either as part of or subsequent to wavelength to wavenumber conversion such as a Hilbert based dispersion algorithm have been previously disclosed.

Further the noise level can be reduced to that of by using the synthetic wavelength image as a reference for correctly unwrapping the single wavelength image. After unwrapping using the synthetic wavelength method the correct x in Eq. 3 can be determined but can contain a high level of noise. Simply dividing the synthetic wavelength result by an integer number of 2 can allows for calculation of the appropriate value of m. This calculation can allow the data to be recast in terms of the source center wavelength. The correctly unwrapped image can have the same level of noise as is expected in the single wavelength case. However areas of the image that possess noise levels of x 4 could cause a miscalculation of m resulting in spikes at these locations throughout the single wavelength corrected image. These spikes can be within 1 wrap and can be removed through a more simple unwrapping technique or filtering.

Based on the relationships discussed above a two window method for can be performed for phase unwrapping of OCT data. First raw OCT spectrum data can be acquired e.g. using a spectrometer . The data can be interpolated to be evenly spaced in k. Compensation can be made for any dispersion in the data either as part of the interpolation of the data or as a separate process. The interpolated data can be processed to obtain a DC spectrum such as by performing a Fourier transform passing the data through a low pass filter to isolate the DC components of the signal and performing an inverse Fourier transform. The raw spectrum can be compared to the DC spectrum e.g. by dividing by or subtracting the DC spectrum to generate an interference signal. Multiple different windows e.g. two Gaussian windows can be applied to resulting interference fringes and further signal processing e.g. Fourier transforms can be performed separately to each of the newly formed spectra. Phase information can then be extracted from each processed signal. One dataset can be subtracted from the other and a value of 2 can be added if the difference is less than zero. The resulting phase data should be unwrapped according to the equivalent wavelength. Conversion of the phase difference to a physical displacement measurement can be obtained by substituting and into Eq. 3 . Reducing the level of noise in the image can then be accomplished by dividing the resulting displacement profile by an integer number of 2 and then adding the corresponding amount of wraps to the single wavelength data.

In one particular example the method described hereinabove can be implemented using a SDPM microscope shown in . The apparatus can consist of an interferometer e.g. a fiber based Michelson interferometer with a sample arm inserted via a documentation port into an inverted microscope e.g. Zeiss Axiovert 200 . A laser e.g. a modelocked Titanium Sapphire laser such as a Femtosource laser produced by Femtolasers Inc. having at about 790 nm and at about 70 nm can serve as a source allowing for an axial resolution of about 5.7 m in air. A spectrometer can use a linescan CCD e.g. Atmel AVIVA 2048 pixel 19 kHz . Sample arm can contain two galvo mirrors and to allow raster scanning of the sample and a series of lenses e.g. imaging lenses L L and L and a tube lens TL . A microscope objective e.g. Zeiss 40 0.6 NA can focus light onto the sample giving a lateral resolution with a diffraction limit of about 1.6 m. Such an objective can be capable for example of resolving the smallest bars on a USAF test chart with 4.4 m spacing per line pair 2.2 m per bar in good agreement with the expected resolution. The signal data of the sample can be communicated to an OCT processor in communication with a computer for analyzing the signal data.

The effects of windowing on the noise of the synthetic wavelength image can be analyzed by placing a glass coverslip e.g. about 150 m thick in the sample arm and acquiring about 500 scans at a single point with 150 s integration time per A scan. Following the synthetic wavelength windowing procedure described above dual Gaussian windows with 40 nm bandwidths can be applied to each of the original spectra the windows being equidistant from the source center. The synthetic phase can be calculated by taking a difference of the phase measurements obtained from Fourier transformation of each pair of windows. This procedure can be repeated for various values of . The phase stability can be measured experimentally by taking the standard deviation of at the peak pixel location of the top coverslip surface in the A scan profile. xcan be calculated using the measured phase stability in Eq. 13 . Theoretically the phase stability depends on the SNR which can be calculated by taking the intensity at the A scan peak squared divided by the variance of the noise floor over a region near the coverslip surface peak. The theoretical xcan be calculated by combining Eqs. 6 9 and 13 . shows exemplary results of this kind of analysis.

Alternatively the phase stability of the system can be measured by focusing light from source onto the top surface of glass coverslip e.g. about 180 m thick . Interference between reflections from the bottom and top surface can produce a single A scan peak after k space interpolation and Fourier transform of the resulting spectral interferogram. The standard deviation of the phase of this peak can be monitored over 1000 lines which can result in about 167 pm for the temporal sensitivity at a single point on coverslip and about 1.5 nm sensitivity for lateral scanning over the surface.

The dual wavelength unwrapping method discussed above can be applied to data obtained by laterally scanning the sample beam across the surface of a calibration step grating e.g. Mikromasch TZ011 about 10 m pitch about 1.5 m step height . In addition AFM profiling of grating can be performed to compare the results. By way of specific example the dual wavelength method can be applied to beating cardiomyocytes adhered to coverslip and the phase can be measured during the contraction of a cell. Micron scale motion can be expected based on volume conservation of the cell volume. Further electrical stimulation can be applied to the cells and correlated with image acquisition.

Referring to results of an exemplary phase unwrapping of a surface profile taken from calibration step grating is shown. The dual wavelength method correctly measures an average step height of 1.50 m. By comparison unwrapping performed by a standard Matlab algorithm only measures an average step height of 70 nm. A 3D surface profile is shown in . AFM profiling of grating e.g. using a Digital Instruments 3100 with 0.5 height resolution can measure an average step height of 1.52 m and is shown in . These results show that the use of a synthetic wavelength can correctly unwrap a phase profile even in the presence of multiply wrapped phase.

In another particular example an atomic force microscope AFM calibration grating can be used to validate the synthetic wavelength technique. The grating can be spaced 150 m away from coverslip surface to avoid phase corruption effects. This can cause a loss in signal due to the coverslip s distance away from the axial focus. Calculating the loss of intensity for backscatterers away from the focal plane can reveal a loss in SNR of about 84 dB. Using Eq. 7 the theoretical sensitivity of our system for a perfect reflector can be calculated using 0.9 with 25 mW power in the sample arm at 150 s integration time yielding a sensitivity of about 130 dB. This can allow detection of reflectors beyond the depth of focus of objective .

Again the synthetic wavelength unwrapping method can be applied to data obtained by laterally scanning the sample beam across the surface of the calibration step grating which can consist of SiOsteps coated with SiNon a silicon wafer to obtain a dataset consisting of 100 50 A scans covering a 20 6 m area with an integration time of 150 s. The 1.5 m step height can be roughly twice the center wavelength of the source and yet can be less than its coherence length. Thus grating can be expected to produce multiple wrapping artifacts in the phase data.

The index of refraction for SiNcan have a trivial complex component at about 790 nm implying normally incident light undergoes a phase shift upon reflection. However the index of refraction of silicon at 790 nm n 3.673 and k 5 10 3 could potentially cause a non phase shift in reflected light. The phase shift deviation from for light incident upon a silicon surface from air may be describe as follows 

Matlab uses a simple algorithm that unwraps the phase by searching for phase discontinuities along a one dimensional path. If the phase jump between two neighboring pixels in an image is greater than or less than this is interpreted as a wrap and 2 is subtracted or added to smooth the phase profile. Thus if more than one wrap is contained within the pixel it will not be correctly unwrapped. It is also possible that a true absolute phase jump greater than will be misinterpreted and perceived by Matlab to be a wrap. Another scenario is that a true wrap may not be detected if the resulting phase change between neighboring pixels does not yield an absolute phase difference greater than . Thus unwrapping using the phase from two different pixels still results in an ambiguous phase measurement. The synthetic wavelength method only uses the information contained within a single data point to generate an unwrapped profile and can utilize a sufficiently large to ensure correct unwrapping. This is possible because of the broadband spectrum of the source and the ability to access its phase information by the Fourier transform. The phase at a single pixel in a given phase image can be measured unambiguously regardless of the phase in the surrounding pixels.

Using the synthetic wavelength phase map as a reference the original single wavelength image was corrected by dividing the synthetic wavelength image by 2 of the source to obtain an integer amount for m in Eq. 3 . This result was then added to the single wavelength phase map to produce an intermediate image. The result in shows regions throughout the dataset containing spikes or regions where the phase was incorrectly determined. The image was corrected by subtracting the intermediate image from the synthetic wavelength image and then adding 2 to areas of the difference map in excess of . However some spikes still remained in regions of the image containing high amounts of noise. These areas are within a 2 wrap or equivalently o 2 from the correct value and can be removed through a simpler software unwrapping method that searches for these sharp steps. A simple unwrapping filter consisting of a 3 3 window was used to compare the phase of the center pixel to an average of the phases of the neighboring pixels. If a phase difference in excess of was detected then the center pixel was unwrapped by the addition or subtraction of 2 . The result of this step is shown in . The noise level for the corrected image taken as the standard deviation of the measure values in the valley of the grating was 3 nm. The measured value for the average step height was 1.51 0.01 m. Portions of the image in contain noise artifacts that were unable to be removed by the unwrapping filter due to high noise levels in the image which corrupt the single wavelength image after correction. However the amplified noise level introduced in the synthetic wavelength image was reduced to the single wavelength noise limit while measuring the correct step height in the presence of multiple wrapping artifacts.

Synthetic wavelength unwrapping can also be applied to phase measurements from cardiomyocytes during contraction. Referring to an OCT magnitude image of a cell is shown. The arrow indicates the direction of bulk cell motion curing a contraction and the three dots correspond to locations of measured displacement shown in red dot corresponding to 0 m green dot corresponding to 1.9 m and blue dot corresponding to 3.8 m . shows a plot of the displacement as measured by the phase over time. Upon electrical stimulation the cell can contract resulting in upward motion of the cell membrane. The synthetic wavelength unwrapping can reveal motion on the order of several microns as the cell contracts.

Synthetic wavelength unwrapping can further be applied to phase measurements from human epithelial cheek cells. The cells were placed upon the top surface of a coverslip which had anti reflective coating to help reduce the effects of phase corruption. The phase profile of a group of cells is shown in through . Images consist of 1000 100 lines acquired using a 20 objective NA 0.5 1.9 m spot size to give a wider field of view for visualizing a group of cells. Initially a wrapped phase profile was obtained in and was then unwrapped using the synthetic wavelength method with 20.4 m. As can be seen from the bright field microscope image in single cells as well as a cluster of cells stacked together were present. The cell cluster should be expected to introduce multiple wrapping artifacts due to its thickness whereas the single cells may produce only a single wrap. After applying the synthetic wavelength algorithm noise reduction to the single wavelength image was performed. Additionally a 3 3 median filter was used to smooth the image. A clear picture of the cell height above the coverslip surface is obtained in . The heights of both single cells and the cell cluster are resolved with the regions of the original image containing either single or multiple phase wraps corrected. The standard deviation over the region indicated by the box in was 31 nm for the synthetic wavelength image and 7 nm for the single wavelength corrected image demonstrating the effects of single wavelength noise reduction.

In summary the subject matter herein presents a synthetic wavelength processing methods to allow for correct phase unwrapping in phase sensitive implementations of OCT. Using two spectral windows on the detected broadband spectrum allows phase information from different wavelengths to be obtained. The phase information can then be related to that of a longer synthetic wavelength to measure large phase jumps in a given sample that would normally induce phase wrapping. The two window method may potentially be extrapolated to use a continuous range of wavelengths similar to to allow even more robust phase unwrapping. This method may prove useful in other phase based implementations of OCT where phase wrapping is problematic such as in Doppler or polarization sensitive OCT or in applications such as cellular imaging.

Although the above disclosure concentrates on the detailed technique for application of synthetic wavelength phase unwrapping in SDPM systems one having skill in the art should understand that the technique is applicable to any form of low coherence inteferometry which resolve phase including all of the techniques mentioned herein above including time domain OCT among others.
